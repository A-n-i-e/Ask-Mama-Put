This soaking and pre-cooking process will help reduce the gas inducing elements.Chop the onions, grind the crayfish (if you are using it) and pepper.If you will use yam/plantain/sweet potatoes, wash, peel and cut them into 1 inch cubes and set aside. If you will use baby corn, drain the preservation liquid, rinse and set aside.  Cooking Directions  Put the beans in a pot and pour water up to the level of the beans and start cooking.Note:If you have a pressure cooker, beans is one of the staple foods you will want to use it for. It reduces the cooking time considerably.Cook till tender, adding more water from time to time, if necessary. Always keep the water at the same level as the beans so that when the beans is done, you will not have too much water in the porridge.When the beans porridge is soft, add the onions, crayfish (if using it), pepper and seasoning.Add the red palm oil, salt to taste and cook for more 5 minutes on medium heat.Note:To get the most out of beans, it is best to cook it with one of the following: sweet yam, ripe/unripe plantain, sweet potatoes or baby corn.

Only a very small quantity should be used. If you are lucky to buy freshly dehusked ukwa seeds from the same tree, you will not need to use the food tenderiser. I do not know any alternative to edible potash.  Before you cook the Ukwa  If using dry ukwa, soak it overnight in plenty of cold water. If using fresh ukwa, skip this step.The next day, soak, debone and wash the dry fish or stock fish and break into pieces.Wash the ukwa thoroughly in cold water. Stones and sand usually settle at the bottom so watch out for those.Pound the pepper.Rinse the bitter leaves and set aside.  Cooking Directions  Put the thoroughly washed ukwa in a sizeable pot. I used a pressure pot in the video below because it cooks the ukwa much faster.Pour enough water to cover the ukwa. The level of water should be about 1 inch above the level of the ukwa.Add the edible potash. Add the dry fish or stock fish, cover the pot and cook till well done. The ukwa is done when the seeds melt when pressed. You may need to top up the water while cooking so watch it closely. If using a pressure pot, top ups will not be necessary.Add enough palm oil to the well done ukwa, add pepper, stock cubes and salt to taste.Stir. Cover and cook on medium heat till the palm oil changes colour from red to yellow. This should take about 5 minutes.Stir and add the bitter leaves.Cover and leave to simmer or till the leaves wilt but still green and the ukwa is ready to be served.  Cooking Ukwa with a Pressure Pot  If you have a pressure pot, ukwa is one of the Nigerian recipes that you should use it for because it cuts the cooking time by a lot.  For pressure pots, follow the directions above up till Step 2.Then for step 3, add edible potash, dry fish or stock fish, pepper, salt to taste, stock cubes and palm oil.Cover, pressurize and cook for 30 minutes. I set the pressure on my pot to 1 and my cooker to heat 7 (my burner's heat settings range from 1-9).After 30 minutes with the above settings, the ukwa should be well done. Depressurize the pot under running water and add the bitter leaves.Cover and cook till the vegetables wilt but are still green. There is no need to pressurize the pot during this step.Stir and it's done!  Note: Breadfruit Porridge gets thicker as it cools down so ensure you have enough porridge in the meal when done.  Serve with chilled palm wine, palmy. Awww!

But the No. 1 reason why lots of people do not like preparing Moi Moi in their homes is because the cooking process is long and laborious. All that peeling of beans, blending, chopping! Nobody has got time for that.Chickpea Moi Moi to the rescue! It looks like beans Moi Moi, it feels like beans Moi Moi in the mouth and believe me it smells and tastes better than beans Moi Moi! Above all, it is easier to prepare than beans Moi Moi!Yes, we can prepare Moi Moi with brown beans without peeling the beans but that's a whole story for another day because I have my reservations about that one.Chickpea Moi Moi [Video]  Ingredients for Chickpea Moi Moi  I got about 10 wraps of Chick Pea Moi Moi with the following ingredients:  1½ cups chickpeas1 habanero pepper (atarodo)2 sweet peppers (fresh paprika)1 big seasoning cube2 cooking spoons vegetable oil2 tablespoons ground crayfish2 teaspoons ground nutmeg1 onionSalt (to taste)Warm water (for grinding and mixing)  Notes on the ingredients  Use dry chickpeas. Do NOT use canned chickpeas because they are already cooked.You can usechickpea flourto prepare Chickpea Moi Moi if that's all you have. I have a recipe whereI used beans flour to prepare Nigerian Moi Moi, the directions on that recipe will work with chickpea flour.Click here.Sweet peppers (fresh paprika) add a nice peachy colour to Chickpea Moi Moi. In Nigeria, use tatashe. Remember that tatashe is spicy so if you do not like spicy food, after adding tatashe, there may not be any need to add habanero pepper.When grinding the beans, use just enough water to help the blades of your blender rotate.For a delicious taste, use tasteless and odourless vegetable oils like the vegetable oils sold in Nigeria and sunflower oil. Do not use olive oil.  Containers you can use to cook the Chickpea Moi Moi  Aluminium foil bags.Click here.Uma leaves (Etere): used in the video below.You can bake it in the oven,click here.You can use aluminium bowls.  Directions  Rinse and soak the chickpeas in cool or lukewarm water for at least 3 hours or till you can cut the seed with your finger nails. You will also be able to peel it by rubbing it between your thumb and index finger. I soaked the one used in the video below for 6 hours.Pour the chickpea in a sieve to drain, after that pour in a bowl.Rinse, deseed and chop the sweet peppers to help your blender.Chop the onions and habanero pepper.Add the chopped sweet peppers, onions, habanero pepper, ground crayfish and seasoning cube (crushed) into the bowl of soaked chickpeas.Mix very well.Blend in batches with warm water till you get a smooth puree. For the quantity of water to use: when blending each batch, add water to just under the level of chickpeas in the blender. That quantity of water is usually the right quantity of water for mixing the Chickpea Moi Moi.Pour into a bowl. Add the oil and salt to taste.Mix very well and scoop into containers of your choice and cook in a steam pot. Watch the video below to see how I set up the pot of boiling water and a base to keep the wraps of Moi Moi away from the water while it cooked.For the quantity prepared in this recipe, I cooked it for 1 hour. For larger quantities, you will require a bit more time. If the water in the post dries up as you cook, add more water.When done, bring out the wraps of Moi Moi and spread on a tray to cool down to a comfortable temperature.  Serve while still hot but not scalding withJollof Rice,Peppered Fish,Fried Plantains,Vegetable Garnishetc.Chickpea Moi Moi stores well in the freezer. When I want to eat from the frozen ones, all I do is bring out the wraps we need and leave on the kitchen counter to defrost on their own, then I warm them up using the same steaming technique used in cooking it.

You can call Dan Wake Beans Dumplings in English because the preparation is similar.How to Cook Dan Wake [Video]Dan Wake on its own is pretty tasteless just like fufu meals and it relies on a sauce or side dish for its taste just like our fufu meals rely on Nigerian Soups for their tastes.Usually Dan Wake is served with ground cayenne pepper (yaji), you can also use Suya Pepper, hardboiled eggs, sautéed vegetables: onions, cabbage, tomatoes; and you can even see some people crush stock cubes and sprinkle on top. Whatever floats your boat, the Dan Wake is game.For me, I searched far and wide for a tasty sauce to enjoy Dan Wake with and one day I found it: 9jafoodie's Ultimate Nigerian Stir-fry is the ultimate partner for Dan Wake. It contains lots of vegetables, Suya pepper, different Nigerian meats etc. Go check it out!  Ingredients  The Dan Wake made with the following quantities of ingredients were enjoyed by 3 people.  2 small party cups beans flour1 smallparty cupcassava flour2 teaspoons baking soda or 2 teaspoons edible potash2 tablespoons kuka powderBeef stock  Serve Dan Wake with any or all of the following:  Ultimate Nigerian Stir-fryGround cayenne pepper (yaji)Suya Pepper (Suya Spice)Sautéed vegetablesSliced VegetablesOnionsCabbageTomatoesCucumberStock CubesHard boiled eggs  OnionsCabbageTomatoesCucumber  Notes on the ingredients  Whatever quantity of Dan Wake you are making, use 2 parts of beans flour to 1 part of cassava flour so like I did above, I used 2 party cups of beans flour and 1 party cup of cassava flour.The job of the cassava flour is to bind the beans flour as it contains lots of starch. If you do not have cassava flour, use plain flour (all-purpose flour).Water is normally used to mix the Dan Wake but I prefer using beef stock because it gives it a better taste rather than the bland taste you get when you mix with water. Even though I use a very tasty sauce to eat Dan Wake, the meal tastes better when it is seasoned all the way through.The job of the edible potash is to make the Dan Wake balls fluffy. I used baking soda (bicarbonate of soda) in the video below, they do the same job.I get the beef stock when I prepare grilled meat. I boil the meat and store the water (stock) in the freezer for preparing these sort of meals. Also, since I normally eat Dan Wake with the Ultimate Nigerian Stir-fry, I will use some of the stock from boiling the meats for the stir-fry to mix the Dan Wake.Kuka Powder which is dried and ground baobab leaves is mucilaginous in nature like Ogbono, not as much as Ogbono though and its job is to help bind the Dan Wake even more.These days some people prepare Dan Wake with only all-purpose flour but the original traditional ingredient for Dan Wake beans flour, try both and see which you prefer.  Before you cook Dan Wake  There's not much pre-preparation going on with Dan Wake. The only thing is that if you are using edible potash, mix it with a small quantity of water and sieve. You will use only the liquid, no sediments. Set this liquid aside.  Cooking Directions  Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl: beans flour, cassava flour, baking soda and kuka powder.If you are using edible potash, add the solution and mix. If not, skip this step.Start adding the beef stock bit by bit and mix the Dan Wake ingredients at the same time till you get a soft sticky dough (see video below). If your beef stock finishes and you still have not achieved a soft sticky dough, continue with warm water.Once you are happy with the dough, set it aside.Pour some water in a pot and set on the stove to boil. The size of your pot and the quantity of water depends on the quantity of Dan Wake you are making. You want a situation where you can put all the molded dumplings in the water and still have lots of room for them to swim around.Once the water boils, start moulding the Dan Wake dough with your fingertips. You pick up a small quantity of the dough (about the size of an adult fufu swallow) with your fingertips and mould into a rough shape (should be like a shapeless amoeba lol) and throw into the boiling water. Repeat till the dough is exhausted. You will notice that the lumps of Dan Wake jumps to the surface of the water as soon as it heats up.Notes:If you want the heart shaped Dan Wake that you can see in the photo above (perfect for St. Valentines btw *wink!), watch the video below to see how I made them with cookie cutters. You can make different shapes the same way.If you used edible potash, the dan wake balls may not be quick to come to the surface when heated but do stir them so they do not stick to the bottom of the pot.Cover the pot and continue cooking on medium heat.After 10 minutes, stir and continue cooking. It should be done in 15 to 20 minutes on low to medium heat.

Remember to turn off your smoke alarm before doing this.To keep the smoke to a minimum and still have the traditional taste of Ewa Agoyin, I use vegetable oil and when it is very hot, I add a small amount of palm oil. Watch the video below to see how I do that.Now add the precooked onions and stir continuously till the onions is fully caramelized. It should be very dark in colour.Add the parboiled tomato puree and stir continuously till you cannot tell the difference between the tomatoes and onions.Add the pepper, crayfish, stock cubes and salt to taste.

Moi Moi Containers  Aluminium foilorPlastic BowlsorUma Leaves(Thaumatococcus Daniellii)Jacket Moi Moi  Tools I used  CookerDeep PotSpatulaChopping boardBlenderKnives  Notes on the ingredients  The tomato puree gives the Moi Moi its classic peachy colour. If you are in Nigeria, the best ingredient to use is tatashe pepper. I do not like the taste of red bell peppers in my Moi Moi hence I do not recommend it but you can try it and see if you like it.Nutmeg gives the Moi Moi its classic taste. If you've ever eaten Nigerian Moi Moi at a party and wondered why it tastes better than the ones you make, it is probably because you do not add nutmeg to your Moi Moi.2 litres of water is the exact quantity of water that gives me the perfect texture of Moi Moi that I and my family love. Please note that this qauntity includes the water used in blending the beans. If using bone marrow, the quantity of stock should be part of the 2 litres of liquid you will use in mixing the Moi Moi. If after using this quantity and you are not happy with the texture, adjust the quantity of water accordingly.It is best to use cool orwarmwater when mixing Moi Moi. You do not want to use hot water for this purpose as it may cause the mix to be lumpy.Using the right amount of oil in your Moi Moi ensures that it has a good texture and rolls off the tongue when you eat it but feel free to use any amount of oil you want. And it is advisable to use tastless and odourless oils in your Moi Moi so that rules out olive oil.  Before you cook Moi Moi  About three hours before cooking the moi moi, soak and wash the beans toremove the coat. When the entire coat has been removed, place the beans in a bowl and pour enough water to cover it. Leave to soak for three hours. This is so that the best consistency will be achieved when you blend the beans.It is advisable to use one of eggs, bone marrow or corned beef, not the three at the same time. If you will use eggs, cook till hard boiled, cut into small pieces and set aside. If you prefer bone marrow, cook it with salt and Maggi / Knorr cubes and set aside the stock. If it is corned beef you will go for, open the can and separate the beef into small lumps.Now go ahead andprepare the moi moi containers.  Next …  Wash the tatashe pepper (if using it). Ensure you remove the tatashe seeds as they have a tendency to give meals a bitter taste.Cut the onions into pieces, grind the crayfish with a dry mill. If using the heavy duty grinder in Nigerian markets, these won't be necessary.Crush the stock cubes and set aside. Wash the habanero/scotch bonnet peppers and set aside.Now that the beans is soaked (the bean seed is tender when you pinch it), it is time to blend it. It is very important that you use a very good blender for this purpose. The taste and feel of your Moi Moi depends so much on the consistency of the blend. If in doubt, put a small quantity of bean seeds in your home blender and grind to the best of its ability using as small quantity of water as possible. Feel the resulting paste with your fingers and if you notice any tiny pieces at all, then the blender is not good for Moi Moi. At this time, you may consider using the commercial heavy duty mills at your local market if you are in Nigeria. Yes, you have your health and hygiene concerns but most of the mill operators actually keep their mills clean. And they let you bring your own water and containers. So there you go!  How to Cook Moi Moi with Tins  Cooking Directions  Blend the beans, tatashe or tomato puree, onions, crayfish, habanero pepper and ground nutmeg together with some of the water and pour the mix into a big enough bowl.Add the vegetable oil and the bone marrow stock (if this is what you have chosen to add to your moi moi).Slowly add the remaining water and stir the mixture at the same time till you get a good mix of all the ingredients.Add salt to taste and stir very well.Note:Moi Moi is one of the Nigerian food recipes that is prepared cold. All the mixing and adding of ingredients is done off the stove. That is to say, once you start cooking, there is no going back! You cannot decide to add more salt or seasoning or a new ingredient later. So getting it right at the mixing stage is very important.Pad the base of a big pot, pour some water and set on the stove. The depth of the water should be at most 1 inch.Dish the Moi moi mix into containers of your choice, add egg/bone marrow/corned beef to each container, seal/cover and set them in the pot.Add as small quantity of water as possible at a time while cooking the Moi Moi as detailed inpreparation and use of moi moi containersso that the moi moi will not become watery when done. This is the case especially when using aluminium foil or uma leaves.The length of time you will cook your Moi Moi depends on the quantity and the Moi Moi container you used.The Moi Moi that gets done quickest is the one wrapped in Uma or Banana leaves, followed by Moi Moi wrapped in aluminum foils then the one that takes the most time is Moi Moi cooked in aluminium or plastic plates.But whatever Moi Moi container you use, it is advisable to cook your Moi Moi for at least 1 hour, before checking it. Confirm that it is done by putting a knife through it, if the knife is stained with Moi Moi paste, then the Moi Moi is not done, but if the knife just has a slight smear of Moi Moi, then it's done. Also, when you cut through the Moi Moi, the insides will be set and not watery.If you are cooking a few wraps of Moi Moi in a small pot on high heat, then it will only take about 45 minutes to get done while when you are cooking a large pot of Moi Moi, it will definitely take more than one hour.  Note:Moi Moi is one of the Nigerian food recipes that is prepared cold. All the mixing and adding of ingredients is done off the stove. That is to say, once you start cooking, there is no going back!

Ingredients  350g brown or black-eyed beans2 Onions3 cooking spoons palm oil or more1 big stock cubeSalt & Habanero pepper (to taste)Water  Side Dish:Fried Plantains  Before you cook Fried Beans  I usually soak beans in cool water overnight. This greatlyreduces beans bloatingand upset stomach associated with eating beans.The next day, chop 1 onion into thin slices, cut the other one into 4 big chunks then pound/grind the pepper.Rinse the beans and put in a sizeable pot. I rinse it twice.Pre-cook the sliced onions with a few drops of water to soften them a bit.  Cooking Directions  Set the pot of beans on the stove. Add the stock cube (crushed) and the chunks of onion. Add enough water to cover the beans and start cooking. Cook the beans till very soft, adding water when necessary. Always keep water to the same level as the beans so that by the time the beans is done, there will not be too much water in the pot.Note:If you have a pressure cooker, use it to cook the beans till soft. I normally use my pressure cooker for beans but for this recipe, I prefer a normal pot so that I can have more control, especially towards the end.When the beans is done, add salt, leave to dry up all the water and transfer the beans to another container.Now, set a dry clean pot on the stove, pour the palm oil and heat it up till the oil melts (if congealed). Note that you should only heat it up, not bleach the oil. You will know it is hot enough when a piece of onion dropped into the oil sizzles.Add the precooked onions and stir for a bit.Add the ground Habanero pepper and stir till everything is heated up very well, at most 2 minutes.Add the beans and stir for about 2 minutes. Add salt if necessary.Cover and leave to simmer for about 2 minutes and it's done.  Note:If you have a pressure cooker, use it to cook the beans till soft.

You can also add to the moi moi after dishing then into cooking bowls or foil bags.  Containers  Aluminium foilorPlastic BowlsorUma Leaves(Thaumatococcus Daniellii)Jacket Moi Moi  Notes on the ingredients  The tomato puree gives the Moi Moi its classic peachy colour. If you are in Nigeria, the best ingredient to use is tatashe pepper. I do not like the taste of red bell peppers in my Moi Moi hence I do not recommend it but you can try it and see if you like it.Nutmeg gives the Moi Moi its classic taste. It is very essential.I used 1.2 litres of water because I love soft Moi Moi. This quantity includes the water used to mix the Moi Moi and that used to mix the dry ingredients. If using bone marrow, the quantity of stock should be part of the 1.2 litres of liquid you will use in mixing the Moi Moi. If after using this quantity and you are not happy with the texture, adjust the quantity of water accordingly but I recommend that you use at least 1 litre of water for the 250g of beans flour else the Moi Moi will be hard.It is best to use cool water when mixing the beans flour.Using the right amount of oil in your Moi Moi ensures that it has a good texture and rolls off the tongue when you eat it but feel free to use any amount of oil you want. And it is advisable to use tastless and odourless oils in Nigerian Moi Moi.  Before you cook Moi Moi  Prepare the moi moi containers.Mix the beans flour with 500mls of cool water, making sure there are minimal lumps. You can achieve this by adding a small quantity of water, mix that then add another small quantity. When done, cover and leave to soak for three hours.It is advisable to use one of eggs, bone marrow or corned beef, not the three at the same time. If you will use eggs, cook till hard boiled, cut each egg into about 4 pieces and set aside. If you prefer bone marrow, cook it with big chunks of onion, salt and stock cubes and set aside the stock. If using corned beef, open the can and separate the beef into small lumps.Wash the tatashe pepper (if using it). Remove the tatashe seeds cut the flesh into tiny pieces. Wash the habanero/scotch bonnet peppers, cut into small pieces and set aside.Cut the onions into pieces, grind the crayfish with a dry mill.Crush the stock cubes and set aside. Grind the nutmeg if you bought the nuts.Mix the ground crayfish, ground nutmeg, crushed stock cubes, pepper and tomato puree with a small amount of water and set aside.  Cooking Directions  After 3 hours, pour the mixture of ingredients into the bowl of soaked beans flour. Add the chopped onions and tatashe (if using it). Stir very well to mix.Blend the mixture from 1 above in small batches without adding any more water till you get a smooth Moi Moi batter. When done, pour into a big enough bowl.Set a small amount of water on the stove to boil. Use a big pot.Slowly add the remaining water to the Moi Moi batter and stir the mixture at the same time.Add the vegetable oil. If using corned beef, add the pieces now. If using bone marrow, add it with the stock at this time. Remember to reduce the total quantity of water you will use for the recipe by the quantity of the bone marrow stock.Add salt to taste and stir very well.By now the water should have boiled. Add a base for the Moi Moi bags to the pot. You can use a metallic wire mesh, pieces of aluminium foil or plastic bags.Dish the Moi moi mix into containers of your choice, add egg to each container, seal/cover and set them in the pot. When done, cover them with a large piece of aluminium foil or a plastic bag to keep the heat in. Then cover start cooking on medium heat.While cooking, keep an eye on the Moi Moi and add some water if necessary.Cook for at least one and half hours and it should be done. If using bowls, it will take longer. Confirm that it is done by putting a knife through it, if the knife is stained with Moi Moi paste, then the Moi Moi is not done, but if the knife just has a slight smear of Moi Moi, then it's done.Spread the bags out on a tray to cool down to a comfortable temperature.  Serve with allNigerian rice dishes,Fried Plantains,Akamu or Ogi(for breakfast) or withSteamed Vegetables.

Okpa!! Okpa!!! If you are travelling to Enugu, Nigeria from Onitsha, Lagos etc, anywhere from the west of Enugu, these shouts from Okpa sellers will remind you that you are approaching Enugu.How to Cook Okpa [Video]How to Wrap Okpa [Images]9th Mile Corner in Ngwo near Enugu is well known for the special Okpa that you can trade your valued possession for. The Okpa is so good that many people have tried severally but failed to replicate the unique taste in their own homes.But the secret to making the best Okpa is to use as few ingredients as possible because okpa beans (Bambara Groundnut or Bambara Beans) have a natural delicious flavour. This flavour is ruined when people start adding lots of seasoning to the meal.Other names for Okpa are Igba and Ntucha.  Ingredients for Okpa  For 12 medium wraps of Okpa, you will need:  450g (1lb or 3½ cups) Okpa flour¾ cup red palm oil1 tablespoon saltHabanero pepper (to taste)1 litre (4 cups) hot water  Okpa wrappers  In addition to the wrappers below, you will also need a strong food safe string/twine for tying the wrappers. I use the strings from the big Nigerian rice bag, you know, the 50kg bags of rice.I advice that you use bowls as a last resort because Okpa needs to be completely immersed in hot boiling water for an even texture when done. This cannot be achieved with bowls.  Dry banana/plantain leavesTough transparent plastic bags that can withstand high heatAluminium foil bagsBowls(use as a last resort)  Notes on the ingredients  Okpa beansis known as Bambara groundnut or simply Bambara nut. In some parts of the world, it is known as Jugo Beans. There are different species of Okpa. It comes insmall podswhich you crack open to release the seeds. The seeds are very hard and only special heavy duty industrial grinders can easily grind these seeds into powder. So, this one is not a job for your kitchen dry mill.If you live outside Nigeria, you can buy Okpa flour onAmazon. You can also ask family or friends to send you Okpa flour from Nigeria. The customs of most countries will allow it because it is dry powder.You need enough oil to give the okpa a popping yellow colour and to improve the taste.Okpa does not need much seasoning so the ingredients listed above are all you need. Onions andcrayfishruin the natural delicious flavour of okpa.The Okpa mix may seem watery but 1.2 litres of water is the quantity of water you need for the perfect Okpa texture. If you add much less water, you will end up with rocky Okpa.  If you live outside Nigeria, you can buy Okpa flour onAmazon. You can also ask family or friends to send you Okpa flour from Nigeria. The customs of most countries will allow it because it is dry powder.  Before you cook Okpa  Prepare the banana leaves by washing them in plenty of salt water. If you have a banana/plantain tree in your backyard, you need to wilt the leaves by passing them over a low flame, then leave them to dry up before using them. You cannot wrap Okpa with fresh banana leaves.Crush the stock/bouillon cubes.Slice the habanero pepper into small pieces.Prepare 1.2 litres of lukewarm water.  Cooking Directions  Sift the Okpa flour into a big enough bowl. Add salt and the crushed stock cubes. Mix very well.Add the palm oil. Mix the palm oil and flour very well till the palm oil is well incorporated into the flour. You will have a niceeven yellow colourwhen done.Pour a generous quantity of water in a big pot and set on the stove to boil.Start adding the lukewarm water to the Okpa flour and mix till there are no lumps. Watch the video below to see how I crush the lumps without stress by passing the mix through a sieve with a wire mesh. You can also use a blender to get the smoothest mix. But that's a lot of washing up to do later.Add the sliced habanero pepper. Check for salt and add more if necessary and it's ready to be scooped into the wrappers!Now the water in the pot should be boiling. If not, wait for it to boil and add some spare wrappers or plastic bags before moving on to the next step. These wrappers and plastic bags act as a base for the Okpa wraps.Now to a major step: wrapping the Okpa! In the video and images below, I showed 3 ways to wrap Okpa: 2 with the banana leaves and 1 with plastic bags. Hopefully the images and explanations make sense but if you really want to master wrapping the Okpa, watching the video is so worth it. Go to a cyber cafe if you can't watch it on your phone/gadget. Some things just can't be adequately explained in writing.After tying one end of the banana leaves as shown in the video and image links below, stir the okpa mix very well and scoop into the leaf/plastic bag. Tie the other end with a string and place the wrapped okpa in the pot of boiling water. It is important that the Okpa is completely immersed in the hot water.Repeat the above step for the rest of the mix. Make sure you stir the mix, scoop into the wrapper, tie with the string and put in the pot of boiling water before wrapping another one.When done, cover the wraps with more leaves or plastic bags. Cover the pot and start cooking medium to high heat.Cook for at least 1 hour before checking it. The Okpa is done when it is solid all over.  Wrapping Okpa  Click on the links to view images.

Your village people have sworn that you can never get this Akamu right so they will continue to laugh at you? Don't worry, I've got your back because I have a permanent solution on this page for you. Make sure you read till the end to see the common reasons why your akamu is watery.If all else fails, do you know that you can also use corn flour or corn starch to make akamu? For those in Nigeria, by corn flour I mean the VERY fine corn flour, the one that is like powder, not the rough one for making alibo.Click hereto see how to do that. The only difference is that it MAY not have the sour taste of akamu. I also have a hack for getting the sour taste on that page.Traditionally processed Ogi, Akamu or Pap with the distinctive sour taste is a great partner to Fried Plantain, Nigerian Pancake, Akara, Fried Yam, Puff Puff etc. Any of these when combined with Akamu, makes a great breakfast meal. Akamu is also a great baby food.How to Make Akamu/Ogi/Pap [Video]How to Make Custard  Akamu is simple yet very difficult to prepare. It is a big challenge for a lot of people.In Nigeria, we usually add evaporated milk to Akamu meals so the main requirement is that the akamu/ogi/pap is thick after preparation so that when the milk is added, a perfect consistency will be achieved.On this page, I will discuss how to prepare the meal for breakfast. If you are looking for how to process Akamu/Ogi/Pap from corn,click here.  What you will need to make Akamu/Ogi/Pap  Wet Corn Starch(Akamu, Ogi or Pap)Water (Hot and Cold)Evaporated Milk (Peak Milk)Sugar (to taste)  Notes on the ingredients  If you can't buy ormake Akamu from scratch, you can use corn starch (corn flour) but the classic sour taste will be missing.Click hereto learn how to hack the sour taste into the corn flour akamu.Peak Milk (evaporated) is the best milk for akamu because it is creamy and its unique taste works well with the sour taste of akamu/ogi. Whole milk, semi-skimmed or skimmed milk are not great for akamu. If making Akamu for your baby, use baby milk.Add sugar to your taste. I have never used other sweeteners in Akamu. For babies, do not add sugar.  Preparation  Put some lumps of akamu/ogi/pap into a sizeable bowl. Akamu rises during preparation so you should use a bowl big enough to contain the meal in its risen state. If in doubt, use a very big bowl, with time, you will learn which quantity can comfortably fit is which bowl size.Use a tablespoon to crush the lumps of ogi into very small pieces.Add cool water in small quantities and mix till you have a medium consistency with no lumps. Your aim should be to mix the akamu as thick as possible. See the video below.Put a kettle of water to boil. Make sure the water will be enough. It is better to boil too much water than not have enough water when making akamu.Just before the water boils, stir the mix very well because some of the ogi may have settled at the bottom of the bowl. If not stirred well, this is the major cause of lumps when you start making it.Once the water boils, pour it slowly but steadily in a circular motion into the bowl of akamu and stir at the same time. Pouring the hot water slowly and stirring at the same is very important because this prevents lumps.Once you see the mixture setting, stop stirring and reduce the flow of water you are pouring till the akamu has completely set.Set the kettle aside and stir the pap very well. If it is too thick for you, you can add more hot water. But be careful else it will become watery. Remember that you will still add liquid evaporated milk.Add peak evaporated milk and some sugar to taste and stir everything to the way you like it.  Common reasons why your akamu is always watery:  It was watery when you mixed it with cool water.You did not wait for the water to boil.You did not pour enough hot water. Lots of people due to fear, often do not add enough hot water. When you start adding hot water, the mix will get watery before it thickens, that's the great science of akamu. So let go of fear and make sure you add enough hot water. Once you got the cool water mix right, and once number 5 did not happen to the akamu, do not fear, it will thciken.Your akamu is not at room temperature when you are trying to make it. You brought the akamu out of the fridge or freezer, mixed immediately and tried to make akamu with it. If the akamu mix is too cold, the hot water, no mater how hot will not be enough to set the akamu. Best practice is bring your akamu out of the fridge the night before and keep it in the kitchen then make in the morning. If you store your akamu in the freezer, bring it out at least 24 hours before you make the akamu. By doing this, the akamu will be at room tenperature at the time you want to make it.The akamu came in contact with salt when it was being processed into corn. Salt is akamu's greatest enemy. So salt found its way into the akamu while it was being processed from corn, then the whole batch of akamu will be affected.Akamu made with dawa is usually a challenging one to make, it is always more watery than akamu made with corn. This is because dawa does not have as much starch as corn. I would even avoid akamu proceed from 100 percent dawa. If I was make akamu with dawa, it is better to mix it with corn to improve the starch.This is an extra tip: when making akamu for a large crowd, do not make the akamu in one BIG pan rather make several batches in smallwer bowls, that way you have more control.

It has a distinctive sour taste that makes people crave it. It is processed from dry white or yellow corn. After processing it we get the raw akamu/pap/ogi which is then prepared with hot water before serving as a meal. On this page, I will explain how to process the raw wet corn starch from dry corn. If you are looking for how to prepare the corn meal visit theHow to Prepare Akamu/Ogi/Pappage.How to Make Akamu/Ogi from Scratch [Video]  You will need:  1.5kg dry cornLots of water  Tools  Chiffon cloth: for separating the wet corn starch (akamu/ogi/pap) from the chaff.Blender: I used Palson with 600W.Muslin bag: Any tightly woven cotton, calico or canvass material whose weaves do not shift is great for this. You can make yours at home if you have a sewing machine and know how to sew. In Nigeria, salt used to come in muslin bags, if you still have such bags, it is perfect for this. You need to wash it well before use as salt is akamu's worst enemy.Big and small bowls.  Notes on the ingredients  I got about 1.2kg akamu from the 1.5kg dry corn.The corn must be dry. Fresh corn cannot form the right kind of starch for making akamu/ogi/pap.We use yellow dry corn for making yellow akamu and white (off-white) corn for making white akamu.You will need lots of water for soaking, washing and seiving the corn.  Important!  Never let salt come in contact with the corn, water and utensils you will use to process the akamu because when that happens, the akamu will not thicken when you prepare it with hot water.  Directions  Wash the dry corn thoroughly and soak in a generous quantity of cold water for 3 to 4 days. Do not refrigerate it because it is important that some kind of fermentation takes place.Wash the corn and change the water daily.On the 3rd or 4th day, wash andblend till smooth. I say 3rd or 4th because some corns become soft enough to be blended by the 3rd day. Bite into it to check, if not soak for one more day. Add a generous quantity of water to help your blender. In Nigeria, heavy duty grinders are used for this purpose.Drape the chiffon cloth over a big bowl and tie it up. The bowl should be big enough to accommodate the ogi and the water you'll use to rinse it and then some.Sieve the blendrinsing as necessary till you are left with only the chaff. It is advisable to rinse small quantities of the corn blend at a time so that you will not be overwhelmed.When you've rinsed all the corn blend, blend the chaff and rinse again if you think you can get more akamu from it. This may be the case if you used a kitchen blender. This won't be necessary if you used the heavy duty grinders in Nigerian markets.When done, take off the chiffon cloth and set the mixture of water and akamu aside to settle for at least 3 hours.After about 3 hours or when you notice that the water is clear,decant the clear waterand pour the rest of the mixture into the muslin bag.Tie the bag and keep it in such a way as tolet the water drainfrom the ogi.When you notice that the water has drained off, tie the bag tighter and leave to continue draining the water. Repeat the process as the water drains till no more water drains off.Tie the bag for the last time and place some weights on it to squeeze out the last trace of water.Leave it like this overnight so that the akamu will have the classic sour taste. Again, do not refrigerate it.The next day, bring out the akamu from the bag, cut it up into single-use chunks, place in containers (bowls or plastic bags) and put in your freezer till you are ready to use it.  I prefer the yellow akamu/ogi/pap because it tastes a little bit better. Some people may not notice the slight difference in taste.To prepare the akamu for breakfast visit theHow to Prepare Akamu/Ogi/Pappage.

Readhow to remove beans coatfor help on how to do that. It is important that you do not let salt come in contact with the beans you will use in making Akara till you are ready to fry it. Salt is believed to destroy the leavening property of beans. This is what prevents spattering of the beans batter during frying.Then soak the beans in water for 2 hours to make it soft enough for your blender. If you will grind it using the heavy duty grinders in Nigerian markets, it will not be necessary to soak the beans for extended periods of time.Cut the pepper and onions into desirable sizes.  Making Akara  Grind the beans with your blender making sure you add as little water as possible. The water should be just enough to move the blades of your blender.The operators of the heavy duty grinders in Nigerian markets don't even add water when grinding beans for Akara. The less water you add at the grinding stage, the more the beans batter will stay together during frying thereby reducing spatter. Also, do not add any other ingredient when grinding the beans for Akara. It is believed that other ingredients, if added too early, reduce the ability of the ground beans particles to stick together.Set some vegetable oil on the cooker to heat up. The oil should be at least 3 inches deep.Put some of the ground beans into a mortar. This should be the quantity you can fry in one go.Stir the beans puree with the pestle in a continuous circular motion. You need to apply some pressure so that you can energize the particles of the beans puree.This stirring technique releases the gas that will act like a leavening agent to the beans particles, making them rise and somehow stick together. This will be like the yeast making the dough rise inPuff Puffor what folding does to cake batter.Keep stirring till the ground beans appears whiter and you can perceive its peculiar aroma.Add some water till you get the consistency shown in the video below.Check to make sure the oil is hot. The oil should be hot enough to sizzle but not too hot. If too hot, the Akara will spatter as soon as the beans batter hits the oil.Once the oil is hot, add the onions and pepper to the beans puree in the mortar. Stir well.Add salt to your taste and stir again. Salt should always be added just before scooping the beans mixture into the oil. If salt stays in the mixture for extended periods of time, it will destroy the leavening property of the beans. This property is what makes the Akara float in the oil and prevent spatter during frying.To fry the Akara, scoop the mixture with a table spoon and slowly pour this into the oil. Dipping the spoon a little bit into the oil helps reduce spatter.Fry the underside till brown and flip to fry the top side too.When the Akara balls are brown all over, remove and place in a sieve lined with paper towels.  The operators of the heavy duty grinders in Nigerian markets don't even add water when grinding beans for Akara. The less water you add at the grinding stage, the more the beans batter will stay together during frying thereby reducing spatter.

Okpa!! Okpa!!! If you are travelling to Enugu, Nigeria from Onitsha, Lagos etc, anywhere from the west of Enugu, these shouts from Okpa sellers will remind you that you are approaching Enugu.How to Cook Okpa [Video]How to Wrap Okpa [Images]9th Mile Corner in Ngwo near Enugu is well known for the special Okpa that you can trade your valued possession for. The Okpa is so good that many people have tried severally but failed to replicate the unique taste in their own homes.But the secret to making the best Okpa is to use as few ingredients as possible because okpa beans (Bambara Groundnut or Bambara Beans) have a natural delicious flavour. This flavour is ruined when people start adding lots of seasoning to the meal.Other names for Okpa are Igba and Ntucha.  Ingredients for Okpa  For 12 medium wraps of Okpa, you will need:  450g (1lb or 3½ cups) Okpa flour¾ cup red palm oil1 tablespoon saltHabanero pepper (to taste)1 litre (4 cups) hot water  Okpa wrappers  In addition to the wrappers below, you will also need a strong food safe string/twine for tying the wrappers. I use the strings from the big Nigerian rice bag, you know, the 50kg bags of rice.I advice that you use bowls as a last resort because Okpa needs to be completely immersed in hot boiling water for an even texture when done. This cannot be achieved with bowls.  Dry banana/plantain leavesTough transparent plastic bags that can withstand high heatAluminium foil bagsBowls(use as a last resort)  Notes on the ingredients  Okpa beansis known as Bambara groundnut or simply Bambara nut. In some parts of the world, it is known as Jugo Beans. There are different species of Okpa. It comes insmall podswhich you crack open to release the seeds. The seeds are very hard and only special heavy duty industrial grinders can easily grind these seeds into powder. So, this one is not a job for your kitchen dry mill.If you live outside Nigeria, you can buy Okpa flour onAmazon. You can also ask family or friends to send you Okpa flour from Nigeria. The customs of most countries will allow it because it is dry powder.You need enough oil to give the okpa a popping yellow colour and to improve the taste.Okpa does not need much seasoning so the ingredients listed above are all you need. Onions andcrayfishruin the natural delicious flavour of okpa.The Okpa mix may seem watery but 1.2 litres of water is the quantity of water you need for the perfect Okpa texture. If you add much less water, you will end up with rocky Okpa.  If you live outside Nigeria, you can buy Okpa flour onAmazon. You can also ask family or friends to send you Okpa flour from Nigeria. The customs of most countries will allow it because it is dry powder.  Before you cook Okpa  Prepare the banana leaves by washing them in plenty of salt water. If you have a banana/plantain tree in your backyard, you need to wilt the leaves by passing them over a low flame, then leave them to dry up before using them. You cannot wrap Okpa with fresh banana leaves.Crush the stock/bouillon cubes.Slice the habanero pepper into small pieces.Prepare 1.2 litres of lukewarm water.  Cooking Directions  Sift the Okpa flour into a big enough bowl. Add salt and the crushed stock cubes. Mix very well.Add the palm oil. Mix the palm oil and flour very well till the palm oil is well incorporated into the flour. You will have a niceeven yellow colourwhen done.Pour a generous quantity of water in a big pot and set on the stove to boil.Start adding the lukewarm water to the Okpa flour and mix till there are no lumps. Watch the video below to see how I crush the lumps without stress by passing the mix through a sieve with a wire mesh. You can also use a blender to get the smoothest mix. But that's a lot of washing up to do later.Add the sliced habanero pepper. Check for salt and add more if necessary and it's ready to be scooped into the wrappers!Now the water in the pot should be boiling. If not, wait for it to boil and add some spare wrappers or plastic bags before moving on to the next step. These wrappers and plastic bags act as a base for the Okpa wraps.Now to a major step: wrapping the Okpa! In the video and images below, I showed 3 ways to wrap Okpa: 2 with the banana leaves and 1 with plastic bags. Hopefully the images and explanations make sense but if you really want to master wrapping the Okpa, watching the video is so worth it. Go to a cyber cafe if you can't watch it on your phone/gadget. Some things just can't be adequately explained in writing.After tying one end of the banana leaves as shown in the video and image links below, stir the okpa mix very well and scoop into the leaf/plastic bag. Tie the other end with a string and place the wrapped okpa in the pot of boiling water. It is important that the Okpa is completely immersed in the hot water.Repeat the above step for the rest of the mix. Make sure you stir the mix, scoop into the wrapper, tie with the string and put in the pot of boiling water before wrapping another one.When done, cover the wraps with more leaves or plastic bags. Cover the pot and start cooking medium to high heat.Cook for at least 1 hour before checking it. The Okpa is done when it is solid all over.  Wrapping Okpa  Click on the links to view images.

Important pan for Tomato Omelette  A non-stick frying pan is best for making omelettes:Buy itin USA|in UK  Before you make the Tomato Omelette  Cut the tomato into small pieces. I prefer to remove the seeds.Cut the onion into small pieces. The onions should be the same quantity as the tomato (after cutting them).Beat the egg, add a pinch of salt and the ground dry pepper if you are using this, stir well and set aside.  Preparation  Set your frying pan to heat up.Melt half of the piece of butter and add the onions. Fry for a few seconds and add the tomato.Fry till they are well heated up, this should take a maximum of 5 minutes on medium heat.Pour this into the egg. Mix well and add more salt if necessary.Set the frying pan back on the stove and melt the other half of the butter.Once the butter melts, slowly pour the egg and tomato mix making sure that it is evenly distributed in the frying pan.Turn the heat down to low. On a scale of 1 to 10, the heat should be at 4.Then wait.Wait till you see the tomato omelette caking. Once the heat is low, it will not burn so you need not worry. Also, using a non-stick frying pan helps ensure that your tomato omelette will not burn.Once it has caked considerably, shake the frying pan and the omelette moves on its own. If it doesn't then it is either the heat is too much or the inside of your frying pan is too rough or both.Gently transfer the omelette to a very flat wide plate. This step is best seen so watch the video below to see how I did that.Cover the omelette in the plate with the frying pan and flip is such that the top side is now at the bottom of the frying pan.

Directions  For the carrot cake:  Peel, grate the carrots and put in a bowl. Set aside.Mix the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, salt and sugar in a bowl. Set aside.Add the vegetable oil to the grated carrots. Mix.Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and add to bowl of carrots.Pour into a blender and blend till smooth.While the blender is still running, start adding the dry ingredients bit by bit till everything is well combined.Pour into muffin cups.Bake in a preheated oven at 180C (350F) for 20 minutes.The carrot cake is ready when it is no longer rising and a wooden skewer comes out clean when inserted into the cake.Bring it out of the oven and leave to cool down then remove from the muffin cups.  For the frosting  Peel the avocado and cut into pieces.Place in a flat plate and mash with a fork.Mix with a hand mixer till very smooth.Start adding the icing sugar bit by bit and mix at the same time till you get a thickness you like for your frosting. It should be as thick as custard.Add 1-2 teaspoons of peal milk and mix with the hand mixer. The Peak Milk gives the avocado frosting a very smooth texture.When happy, scoop the avocado frosting into a piping bag and pipe onto the top of the cupcakes.

More information about the Nigerian Cake Ingredients  The flour to use for your Nigerian CakeYou MUST use plain flour for you to have success with the Nigerian Cake recipe detailed on this page. I do not know what using a self-rising flour will do to your cake if you use it. The problem with self-rising flour is that they never state the amount of the leavening agent (in this case, baking powder) they added to the flour. This is why I prefer plain flour so that I have more control over the amount of baking powder that I add to the cake recipe.  The butter to use for you Nigerian CakeFor those living in Nigeria, please use baking butter NOT margarine. You should be able to buy baking butter from any shop that sells bakery ingredients. For my US audience whose butter comes in sticks. I don't know the weight of 1 stick of butter. Maybe this is written on the wrapping so you can check it and then know how many sticks correspond to 1.1 lbs.Please do not melt the butter. Bring it out from the fridge the day before you make your Nigerian cake. This way, it will be soft enough for creaming on the day you'll bake the cake.  SugarIf you think your granulated sugar is too coarse, you can grind it with a dry mill (the one used for grinding egusi, ogbono, etc) before adding it to the butter for creaming. You only need to grind it a little bit to reduce the size of the grains of sugar. This reduces the creaming time.  FlavourThe job of the vanilla extract is just to add a vanilla flavour to the cake. If you want another flavour such as butterscotch (used in wedding cakes) etc, please use it to replace the vanilla flavour and add it when I add the vanilla flavour.  Dry FruitsIf you want to add dry fruits such as raisins, please soak these in brandy for at least 1 week (up to 1 month for Nigerian wedding cakes) before adding it to your cake. This is so that the fruits will not make the cake go bad or taste funny after some time especially for Nigerian Wedding cakes which people like to keep for a longer time.  BrandyThe brandy is a preservative for the cake. With all those eggs in the cake, it can go bad before the event if you don't add brandy or any other cake preservative to it. Here, I am talking about if you will place the cake on the counter for a few days while decorating it (especially for wedding cakes). But if you are making a cake that you will throw into your freezer as soon as it has cooled down, then no need for the brandy.But please do not go overboard with the brandy. You don't want people to feel tipsy after eating your cake.  Before you make the Nigerian Cake  Make sure that all the utensils and appliances you will use for the cake are clean and dry.Check, check and check that you have all the ingredients you will need to bake the cake.Print out the Nigerian cake recipe and keep it close by. For those who prefer using the video, bring your laptop close enough. LOLEverything ready? Let's go!  Making the Nigerian Cake: Step by Step  1. Cream the butter and the sugar  Put the soft butter and the granulated sugar into the mixer andstart creaming.I used the highest setting on my mixer which is a 300 Watts appliance and the creaming took me a total of 1 hour.Please follow the instructions in the user manual of your mixer when creaming. For my mixer, the instruction says that I should not run the appliance for more than 10 minutes at a time. So, I cream for 10 minutes, stop to let the mixer rest and cool down, I run it again for ten minutes etc. And it took me a total of 1 hour creaming time (stoppage time NOT included) to completely cream the butter and the sugar. Your own time may be more or less depending on the type of mixer you have and the size of the grains of your sugar.Awell-creamed sugar/butter mixshould look much whiter than the butter you started with, softer (it should be able to drop from a spoon, see video) and you can barely feel the granulated sugar when you taste the creamed butter and sugar. Some granulated sugar may be stubborn and you can still feel the grains but it's OK so long as the butter/sugar mixture is as white and soft as possible.  2. Prepare your baking pan  When you are almost done with the creaming, prepare your cake pan byrubbing the insideswith soft butter. Then put some flour into the greased pan, making sure the flour touches every part, then pour out the flour.The greasing andflouringof the insides of your cake pan will prevent the cake from sticking to the pan thereby making it easy for you to bring out the cake from the pan when done, without denting the cake.  3. Beat the Eggs  Break all the eggs into a big bowl andwhiskthem to a smooth blend.  4. Add the eggs and mix  Before you do this step, you should make sure that your butter and sugar are well creamed.If your mixer is big enough to accommodate the creamed butter and sugar with the whisked eggs,add the whisked egginto the mixer. Mix till you have a smooth fluffyblend of the creamed butter/sugar and the eggs.If your mixer is not big enough, transfer the creamed butter and sugar to a bigger bowl. Add the eggs and use a hand mixer to mix the two till you get a fluffy smooth blend. My mixer is quite small so this is what I did in the video below. This took me about 5 minutes with my 300 Watts hand mixer which is extractable from my mixer.  5. Turn on your oven to preheat  It's now time to turn on your oven to 150°C or 302°F so that it can start heating up while you finish mixing the cake. You should also switch it to the up & down heat setting.  6. Add the ornamental ingredients  Add the vanilla extract or any other flavours of your choice, add the brandy and pre-soaked dry fruits (if any) and stir with a wooden spatula till everything is well incorporated. Add some browning if you are baking a Nigerian wedding cake. This is what gives the cake the dark colour.  7. Add the plain flour with the baking powder  Now, add the baking powder to the plain flour.Put the mix into a sieve or a flour sifter. Add small quantities of the flourthrough the sieve/sifterinto the bowl where you already have other cake ingredients.Stir very well with the wooden spatula. Add another small quantity of the flour with baking powder. Stir.Repeat this process till all the flour is incorporated. I warn you, this procedure can make your arm die a bit so be sure you are ready for the arm exercise before you start.Notes:It is advisable to stir the cake mix in one direction, in a folding fashion, when adding the flour because most cake experts say that when you stir in the opposite direction, air bubbles will be trapped in your cake mix and your cake will have holes in it when done.It is important to pass the flour through a sieve or sifter so that you are sure that the flour that enters the cake mix in its finest powder form. You don't want to have small lumps of flour in your cake do you? This also ensures a very smooth cake mix.

You don't want to have small lumps of flour in your cake do you? This also ensures a very smooth cake mix.  8. Pour the cake mix into the greased cake pan  Once every ingredient is well incorporated, it's time topour the mix into the greased cake pan.If you want to make a multicolour layered cake then you should at this point divide the cake mix into the number of colours you want. Put these into separate clean dry bowls. Add the colours to each, stir well and pour into the cake pan one after the other. You should make sure you level out each coloured cake mix as much as possible before pouring another one.Once you've poured in all the cake mix into the cake pan, gently lift and drop the cake pan several times to level out the cake mix as much as possible (see video). Don't worry if the top is not so smooth, as soon as the heat of the oven gets to it, it will level out.  9. Baking Time!  Transfer the cake to the preheated oven, placing the rack halfway between the top and the bottom of the oven.Bake for at least 2 hours before attempting to open the oven door to check the cake. It took my cake 2 hours to rise to maximum and if you open the oven door before the cake has fully risen, you have interrupted the baking process, the cake will stop rising, may not be evenly cooked when done and it will be harder than normal when done. There are endless things that can go wrong with your cake if you do not wait for it to rise fully before opening the oven door. That it smells like cake does not mean that it is done.Even though mine took 2 hours, you should keep an eye on yours till you notice that it is no longer rising before attempting to open the oven door. All ovens are not the same so you should use my baking time as a guide only.  10. Check the Cake  After 2 hours, when I'm sure that the cake is no longer rising, I check it by driving a knife into the center of the cake. If the knife comes out with smears of the cake mix, then the cake is not done. If it comes out clean and dry, with only a smear of butter (oily look) then the cake is done. If the cake passes the knife test, I go on to do the other tests.The second way I check the cake is to take a look at the sides of the cake pan. The cake should be separated from the pan or at least not stuck to the pan.The third way I check that the cake is done is to dip a wooden skewer (stick) into the middle of the cake. Wooden skewers are a bit rougher than knives so they tend to pick up smears more. So if the wooden skewer comes out clean, the cake should be done.Even when my cake passes all of the above checks, I still carry out the fourth test so that I can be doubly sure that it is done before bringing it out of the oven. Nobody wants to end up with an undone cake. The fourth and final check I carry out is to gently push the cake down at the middle with my open palm. If the cake springs back when I lift my palm and there is no impression of my palm on the cake, then the cake is done.  11. Cool and Decorate/Refrigerate  Once you are sure that the cake is done, bring it out of the oven and leave it alone for only 5 minutes then take out the sides of the pan. Then leave to cool down completely beforedecorating the cake.You can also cut it up in desirable sizes and store in the freezer.  That's how the Nigerian Cake is made. You can serve it up as a snack with a chilled drink or eat it as a dessert. When decorated, use for birthdays and weddings.

It's surely a great snack to catch up on the latest gist or watch a football match over, with some chilled drinks to wash it down.Serve your Jollof Rice with Peppered Chicken and watch your family lighten up over the dinner table.Peppered Chicken [Video]Peppered Chicken is indeed the popping red, spicy answer to the basic Grilled Chicken.  Ingredients  1.2kg chicken2 tatashe peppers1-2 Scotch bonnet peppers or habanero peppers2 onions1 cooking spoon vegetable oil6 small stock cubes1 tablespoon thymeSalt (to taste)  Notes on the ingredients  Use hard chicken (hen) because the taste is richer than that of the soft chicken (cockerel or rooster).Tatashe peppers are Nigerian spicy red pointy peppers. Outside Nigeria, use Tribelli peppers (Pimentos Tribelli in Spanish). The peppers produce a popping red juice when blended making it a great alternative to our Nigerian Tatashe. The only difference is that Tribelli peppers are not spicy. Tribelli peppers are sold under different brand names in different countries.The Scotch bonnet peppers (alternative habanero peppers) is atarodo, ose oyibo or atarugu. Its job is to add more bite to the tatashe. If you do not like spicy hot food, you can use only tatashe. I use a combination of Tribelli peppers and scotch bonnet because Tribelli peppers are not hot and if you want to use only scotch bonnet peppers for this, the peppered chicken will be too spicy and you will not enjoy it even if you love spicy food.The thyme should have fine particles. I add the thyme from a shaker that has tiny holes so that only the tiniest particles pass through.One of the onions is for cooking the chicken while the other is for garnish. Use red onions for garnish.  Before you prepare the Peppered Chicken  Cut one of the onions into tiny pieces and cut the other into thin slices.Remove the seeds from the tatashe or Tribelli peppers, cut them (as well as the scotch bonnet peppers) into small pieces and blend with a hand blender. The blending should be coarse not smooth (see video). Any blender that allows you to grind the pepper without adding water should do. For a normal blender, add just enough water to help the blades of your blender move.Clean the chicken. Cut them into desireable sizes if you bought whole chicken. Place in a bowl and add the thyme, diced onions and stock cubes (crushed). Massage the seasoning and spices into the chicken with your hands, cover and put in the fridge to marinate for at least 1 hour.  Directions for making Peppered Chicken  When the chicken has marinated for 1 hour, place in a pot, pour some water and start cooking. I add water because I use a pressure cooker. If using a normal pot, just start cooking and by the time it starts to boil, water will seep out from the chicken.When the chicken is done, take them out and grill/broil in the oven at 180°C (350F) till golden all over. If you are preparing another meal on the same day (say Nigerian Jollof Rice), use the chicken stock (water from cooking the chicken), to prepare it. If you are just preparing Peppered Chicken to serve with a chilled drink, put the chicken stock in your freezer, chicken stock always comes in handy when you are preparing another meal.Pour the vegetable oil in a dry pot and heat it up.Add the pepper blend and start frying on low to medium heat till all the water dries up.Add the grilled/broiled peppered chicken and stir very well with a spatula till the popping red peppers have coated every inch of the chicken. Add salt at any time if necessary.That's it!  Serve with anyNigerian Rice dishand/orSalads. You can also serve it as a snack with a chilled drink.

I just set the bag of suya pepper on one side, scoop a small quantity into the tray that I am using to dab the fillets, use that one up and scoop more till I have dabbed all the chicken fillets of suya that I am making.The thing is to look at the quantity of suya spice you have and decide how heavily coated you want the fillets. With a well prepared Suya Pepper, even if you just sprinkle the fillets with the spice, the end product will still taste like suya.With all that said, for 1kg (2.2 lbs) of chicken breast, I used about 200g of suya pepper.

Putting the beef on sticks is optional so you can actually skip this step but it's not Nigerian Chicken Suya if it's not on a stick.Put some vegetable oil in a bowl, add a small quantity of salt and stir. Using a cooking brush, rub the vegetable oil on the threaded fillets of chicken. This is what helps the suya spice stick to the chicken so make sure you rub the oil on every part of the chicken fillets.Spread thesuya spicein a wide dish and dab the threaded fillets of chicken in the spice so that all parts of the chicken is covered with the suya spice.Place the sticks of spiced chicken fillets in a flat plate and cover with a think plastic film or aluminium foil.Place in the fridge to marinate for at least 1 hour.

In Nigeria, look for it in Shoprite or Spar or any other supermarket that sells foreign condiments. Making your own barbecue sauce is not worth it, it is better to look for it and buy.The thyme should have fine particles. I add the thyme from a shaker that has tiny holes so that only the tiniest particles pass through. The long pieces of thyme does not look good on barbecue chicken drumsticks when done. You can also grind the thyme with a dry mill (or coffee grinder) before adding.I used onion powder so as not to have pieces of onions on the barbecue chicken. You can add any other fresh seasoning of your choice: onions, garlic etc but grind them very well so the pieces do not stand out.You really do not need that much extra seasoning because barbecue sauce already contains lots of seasoning.

For this barbecue chicken, I leave mine in the fridge overnight. This is so that the seasoning and spices will have time to seep into the chicken making it taste better.When the desired time has elapsed, set your oven to top and down heating (bake) and 220°C or 425F and leave to preheat for about 10 minutes.Line your oven tray with a baking sheet and gentlylay the marinated drumsticks flaton the baking sheet.

There are many types of seasoning and vegetables you can use for your roasted chicken and there a many ways to go about it but the method detailed on this page is how my Mum does it!  Ingredients  Main ingredient  1 whole chicken  Seasoning for the body of the chicken  1 big stock cube1 teaspoon dry ground cayenne pepper (or ground black pepper)½ teaspoon ground ehu seeds or Calabash Nutmeg (optional)  Stuffing  1 cigar cup or 180g long grain parboiled riceVegetables1 Carrot1 handful green peas (or green beans)Seasoning1 medium onion1 big stock cube2 teaspoons curry powder (no chilli)1 teaspoon thymeSalt to taste2 tablespoons vegetable oil  1 Carrot1 handful green peas (or green beans)  1 medium onion1 big stock cube2 teaspoons curry powder (no chilli)1 teaspoon thymeSalt to taste  Side Dish: Roasted Potatoes  6 medium Irish potatoesLeftover seasoning from that of the chicken1 teaspoon thyme.2 tablespoons vegetable oilSalt to taste  More information about the Roasted Whole Chicken ingredients  The chicken  I use rooster or cockerel which is the male chicken because it is softer and cooks quicker than hen, the female chicken. Even though hen is tastier, it will take much longer to get done if you use it for this recipe.  Seasoning for the body of the chicken  I only add ground ehu seeds to give the chicken a sort of barbecue/peppersoup flavour.Feel free to use other seasoning you like.  Stuffing  You can experiment with other herbs, seasoning and vegetables. It is not advisable to use soft vegetables because they will be overcooked by the time the chicken is done.  Side dish  You can skip the potatoes and use only rice. Just parboil the quantity of rice that will be enough for the stuffing and side dish. Cover the rice with aluminium foil so that it will not be dry when done.  Before you roast the chicken  Prepare the blend of seasoning for the body of the chicken by mixing the dry ground pepper, stock cube (crushed) and ground ehu seeds.Scrape and cut the carrots into small cubes and cut the onion into small pieces.Peel andcut the potatoes into wedges. You can leave the skin on if you want.  Making the Roasted Whole Chicken: Step by Step  1. Prepare the stuffing.  Parboil the ricelike you would parboil rice for Nigerian Jollof Rice. Rinse and put in a sieve to drain. If you will be using only rice as your side dish, you will need to parboil enough rice for this purpose.Put it in a bowl, add the curry powder and mix well.Add the diced carrots, green peas, diced onions, thyme, salt to taste and some vegetable oil. Stir well and set aside.  2. Stuff the Chicken  Wash the chicken and dry with a towel.Stuff the inside with the seasoned rice and vegetables. Do not over fill it because remember that this rice is only parboiled and it will rise as it cooks.When done, tie the legs of the chicken. This helps the chicken maintain a more presentable shape. You don't want it sagging and all over the place.Set your oven to 180°C (350°F) to preheat.Rub some vegetable oil on the chicken, sprinkle the blend of seasoning we prepared earlier and rub it all over the body of the chicken.Make sure the chicken's wings are tucked away under the chicken or into the string you used to tie up the chicken.  3. Prepare the side dish  If you want to use only rice as your side dish, then you should have prepared enough in step 1.If using potatoes, place the wedges in a bowl, add the remaining seasoning from the one you rubbed on the body of the chicken, add thyme, salt to taste and some vegetable oil.Toss to evenly distribute the seasoning and set aside.  4. Arrange, then roast  Dish the remaining rice from the stuffing into an oven tray leaving some space at the centre for the chicken.Place the chicken at the centre.Add the seasoned potatoes around the chicken and place in the preheated oven and bake for one and a half hours.The chicken is done when it is golden, the rice inside the chicken is well done and a cut into the chicken thigh shows a white flesh with some succulent juice.If the skin is pinkish or even red, the chicken is not done.  That's it! It's not that hard after all, is it? Serve portions of the chicken with the rice and roasted potatoes.\", 'category': 'Nigerian Chicken Recipes'}, {'title': 'Grilled Chicken', 'image_url': 'https://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/grilled-chicken.png', 'url': 'https://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/chicken/grilled-chicken/', 'information': 'Grilled Chicken  Chicken is used a lot when preparing Nigerian recipes, especially the Rice recipes and stew recipes. Chicken can also be eaten as a snack and washed down with a chilled drink.How to Season & Grill (Broil) Chicken [Video]  Ingredients  You want to season your chicken so that it will be very tasty and you also want to prepare it such that it will be presentable and appetizing.Seasoning chicken is very easy and you only need a few ingredients. Most often, people think that you have to add all the spices and stock cubes in the world to make the chicken tasty. But what all these excess seasoning does to the chicken is to take away the natural flavour of the chicken. To season chicken, you only need these major spices and ingredients:  Chicken: Hen (female chicken) is tougher and tastier than cockerel (male chicken) so when you go to buy chicken, ask your grocer or meat seller for the hen. This is called Gallina in Spanish. You should also buy a whole chicken and cut it up in pieces. Not only is it cheaper but you get the different parts of the chicken which adds to the flavour rather than just one part.Onions: White, yellow or red onions. Onions are very important when seasoning chicken.Thyme: This is very essential due to the aroma it adds to the chicken.Stock cubes: Maggi or Knorr are the brands that bring out the best taste in Nigerian recipes.Salt: Use salt sparingly when seasoning your chicken. Salt should be added when the chicken is done. Never add salt to raw chicken, see notes below for more information on what adding salt too early does to your chicken or beef.  You should also grill your chicken after cooking it rather than deep-fry it. If you have an oven, please grill your chicken because it is healthier. Grilling also makes the chicken taste better.  Directions for Seasoning and Grilling Chicken  Cut up the whole chicken to desired pieces. Most grocers or meat sellers will do this for you and save you the job.Put the chicken pieces in a pot; add diced onions, thyme and stock cubes.Pour enough water to just cover the contents of the pot and start cooking.Since the hen is tough, it takes quite some time to get it well cooked. It usually takes me one hour 15 minutes on medium heat with a normal cooking pot to get it done to the way I like it. Depending on the heating capacity of your cooker, this may take less. Also if you use a pressure cooker, it will take even much less time so keep an eye on it so that it does not get too soft.When the chicken is done, add some salt, cover the pot and leave to simmer for about 2 minutes. Adding salt at the beginning will make your chicken cook in more time because salt toughens the chicken and some other food stuff.Transfer the chicken to a sieve to drain.Then place them on your oven rack, place the rack as close to the grill (the top heater in your oven) as possible.Switch your oven to \"Grill\" or if you are in the USA, \"Broil\" and set the temperature to 170°C or 338°F.When the top side becomes brown, turn the pieces of chicken on the other side.The chicken is well-grilled when both sides are brown.  Notes about cooking the chicken:  Add water up to the level of the contents of the pot when cooking the chicken.When cooking chicken, I do not add salt to the raw chicken. This is because salt closes the pores of the chicken (and infact anything you are cooking), this prevents the natural flavour of the chicken from coming out into the surrounding water and prevents the seasoning from entering the chicken to improve the taste. The result is that your chicken stock will not have a rich natural taste. It will only have an artifical taste of seasoning.Salt also hardens the chicken hence it takes longer to cook.I only add salt when the chicken is done. A lot of people think that adding salt early makes the chicken taste better but there\\'s a big difference between a salty taste and a rich taste. I believe that what gives food a rich taste is not salt but the natural flavour of the food so allow this natural flavour to come out into your stock by NOT adding salt too early. And remember, stock cubes already contain salt so you really don\\'t need more salt.I do not use Nigerian curry powder to season my chicken simply because it changes the colour of the chicken and gives it an artificial overpowering taste. You can add curry powder to stews that you use the chicken or beef for. But if you don\\'t mind the colour and taste it gives the chicken, feel free to add it when steaming the beef or chicken.  Salt also hardens the chicken hence it takes longer to cook.  I only add salt when the chicken is done. A lot of people think that adding salt early makes the chicken taste better but there\\'s a big difference between a salty taste and a rich taste.

Notes on the ingredients  The quantity of cassava tubers you need depends on the quantity of starch you want to make. Starch stores well in the freezer so you can make large quantities and store.You need water to rinse, blend and sieve the starch.  Directions  It is much better to watch the process than read about it so watch the video below for details.  Peel the cassava tubers following the natural peel lines.Rinse with cool water.Cut into small pieces.Blend in the blender using as little water as possible.Separate the chaff from the cassava blend using the chiffon cloth. Rinse with clean water till all the starch has been washed off the chaff.Leave the starch in the bowl for at least 3 hours so that the starch will settle at the bottom of the bowl. When settled, clear water will be seen at the top while the starch will be at the bottom of the bowl.Decant the clear water and pour the watery starch into the muslin bag.Tie up the muslin bag and leave on the sink tray for the remaining water to drain. This may take overnight to happen.When the starch is all solid, it is ready to be used. Store in the freezer for up to 2 months.

Visit this link to learnHow to Season & Grill Chicken.  Ingredients  You only need a few spices to perfectly season your chicken or beef. There are a lot of spices that claim to be the perfect seasoning for your beef/chicken but this is not true. What these spices do is to take away the natural taste of your beef or chicken and make them taste somewhat artificial. To deep-season beef/chicken, you will need only the following ingredients.  3 Stock Cubes (Maggi/Knorr) per kilogram of beef2 tablespoons of Thyme per kilogram of beef2 medium sized onions per kilogram of beefSalt (to taste)  Note:1 kilogram (kg) = 2.2 pounds (lbs)  Procedure for Deep-Seasoning the Beef/Chicken  Wash the beef and put it in a bowl making sure there is as little water as possible in the bowl.Squeeze and sprinkle the stock cubes (Maggi or Knorr) on the meat.Then add thyme. Do NOT add salt yet. If you add salt now, it will seal up the pores of the meat and prevent the ingredients from entering into the meat.Using your hands, rub the meat so that all the ingredients are mixed with it.Cover the bowl and leave it to marinate (absorb the ingredients) for about 1 hour. If you have a thin plastic film, use it to cover the bowl, if not, no problems just cover it with whatever you have. You can place it in your fridge if you want.To start cooking, simply place the meat in a cooking pot, add onions and start cooking on medium heat. If you are seasoning beef, do NOT add water. For chicken, just add water up to the level of the chicken.Beef contains a lot of liquids so you will notice that the meat will produce a lot of water once it starts to simmer. Usually, this liquid should be enough to cook your meat till it is done.When the beef/chicken is done, add salt to your taste and leave to cook for about 2 minutes. Be careful so that you don't add too much salt. Stock cubes contain salt and sometimes this salt is enough to make the beef/chicken taste good.By this time, there will be as little water as possible in the meat. Transfer the beef/chicken to a sieve to drain.Add the beef stock (water from the beef) to your Tomato Stew, Jollof Rice etc when cooking. For Tomato Stew, add the beef/chicken when the Tomato Stew is completely done. For Jollof Rice, you can fry or grill the meat/chicken and serve with the rice.  Hope this will help you prepare the perfectly seasoned beef/chicken from now on.\", 'category': 'Cooking Tasks and Skills'}, {'title': 'Grilled Chicken', 'image_url': 'https://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/grilled-chicken.png', 'url': 'https://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/chicken/grilled-chicken/', 'information': 'Grilled Chicken  Chicken is used a lot when preparing Nigerian recipes, especially the Rice recipes and stew recipes. Chicken can also be eaten as a snack and washed down with a chilled drink.How to Season & Grill (Broil) Chicken [Video]  Ingredients  You want to season your chicken so that it will be very tasty and you also want to prepare it such that it will be presentable and appetizing.Seasoning chicken is very easy and you only need a few ingredients. Most often, people think that you have to add all the spices and stock cubes in the world to make the chicken tasty. But what all these excess seasoning does to the chicken is to take away the natural flavour of the chicken. To season chicken, you only need these major spices and ingredients:  Chicken: Hen (female chicken) is tougher and tastier than cockerel (male chicken) so when you go to buy chicken, ask your grocer or meat seller for the hen. This is called Gallina in Spanish. You should also buy a whole chicken and cut it up in pieces. Not only is it cheaper but you get the different parts of the chicken which adds to the flavour rather than just one part.Onions: White, yellow or red onions. Onions are very important when seasoning chicken.Thyme: This is very essential due to the aroma it adds to the chicken.Stock cubes: Maggi or Knorr are the brands that bring out the best taste in Nigerian recipes.Salt: Use salt sparingly when seasoning your chicken. Salt should be added when the chicken is done. Never add salt to raw chicken, see notes below for more information on what adding salt too early does to your chicken or beef.  You should also grill your chicken after cooking it rather than deep-fry it. If you have an oven, please grill your chicken because it is healthier. Grilling also makes the chicken taste better.  Directions for Seasoning and Grilling Chicken  Cut up the whole chicken to desired pieces. Most grocers or meat sellers will do this for you and save you the job.Put the chicken pieces in a pot; add diced onions, thyme and stock cubes.Pour enough water to just cover the contents of the pot and start cooking.Since the hen is tough, it takes quite some time to get it well cooked. It usually takes me one hour 15 minutes on medium heat with a normal cooking pot to get it done to the way I like it. Depending on the heating capacity of your cooker, this may take less. Also if you use a pressure cooker, it will take even much less time so keep an eye on it so that it does not get too soft.When the chicken is done, add some salt, cover the pot and leave to simmer for about 2 minutes. Adding salt at the beginning will make your chicken cook in more time because salt toughens the chicken and some other food stuff.Transfer the chicken to a sieve to drain.Then place them on your oven rack, place the rack as close to the grill (the top heater in your oven) as possible.Switch your oven to \"Grill\" or if you are in the USA, \"Broil\" and set the temperature to 170°C or 338°F.When the top side becomes brown, turn the pieces of chicken on the other side.The chicken is well-grilled when both sides are brown.  Notes about cooking the chicken:  Add water up to the level of the contents of the pot when cooking the chicken.When cooking chicken, I do not add salt to the raw chicken. This is because salt closes the pores of the chicken (and infact anything you are cooking), this prevents the natural flavour of the chicken from coming out into the surrounding water and prevents the seasoning from entering the chicken to improve the taste. The result is that your chicken stock will not have a rich natural taste. It will only have an artifical taste of seasoning.Salt also hardens the chicken hence it takes longer to cook.I only add salt when the chicken is done. A lot of people think that adding salt early makes the chicken taste better but there\\'s a big difference between a salty taste and a rich taste. I believe that what gives food a rich taste is not salt but the natural flavour of the food so allow this natural flavour to come out into your stock by NOT adding salt too early. And remember, stock cubes already contain salt so you really don\\'t need more salt.I do not use Nigerian curry powder to season my chicken simply because it changes the colour of the chicken and gives it an artificial overpowering taste. You can add curry powder to stews that you use the chicken or beef for. But if you don\\'t mind the colour and taste it gives the chicken, feel free to add it when steaming the beef or chicken.  Salt also hardens the chicken hence it takes longer to cook.  I only add salt when the chicken is done.

This length of time will depend on the type of beans. But as soon as you can easily remove the beans coat by rubbing a few of them together in your hand, then the beans is ready to go “coatless”.The first method of the beans coat removal is by rubbing the soaked beans between your palms till all the coat has come off of the beans seeds. This method is quite tedious and can take hours on end.The second method is byusing a food blender.The third method is by using a mortar and pestle (as shown in the video below).  Procedure for Removing the Beans Coat  Soak the beans in cool water till you can easily get the beans coat off by rubbing the seeds with your fingers. You will notice that the coat is baggy and separated from the beans seed. If you leave it for too long in the water, it will become more difficult to remove the coat from the beans.Once you have confirmed that the seeds are ready for the beans coat removal, drain the water from the beans else the seeds will continue to soak up more water.Then scoop a small quantity of the seeds into a mortar that has some friction. Use a pistle to rub the beans seeds against the insides of the mortar and watch as the coats come off the seeds. The very smooth mortars will not work here because you need the friction to get the coat off the beans.Repeat this process for all the beans seeds and put the removed ones in a large bowl when done.Pour a generous quantity of water into the bowl such that the beans coat are separated from the seeds and they float on the water.Decant the floating beans coat, pour more water and decant. Repeat the process till all the free beans coats have been removed. You may have some stubborn beans coats that did not come off the beans seeds. Hand-pick these, place in a mortar and rub off the coats with a pistle. Wash as before till you have clean completely coatless seeds.Soak the beans for about 3 hours before blending.

It is the perfect way to recycle the chaff that I get when Iextract coconut milk. You can also use coconut flakes for this but the Shuku Shuku made with those are lighter.  Ingredients for Shuku Shuku  I prepare Shuku Shuku in 2 ways. The first one (shown on the right in the image above) requires baking while the second does not.  For the baked method you will need:  120g coconut chaff (or coconut flakes)3 egg yolks30g icing sugar (powdered sugar)Bread crumbs  For the low carb version use:  120g coconut chaff (or coconut flakes)3 egg yolks2 drops stevia or to taste  For the no-bake method you will need:  120g coconut chaff (or coconut flakes)Evaporated milk (Peak Milk)30g icing sugar (powdered sugar)Bread crumbs  For the low carb version use:  120g coconut chaff (or coconut flakes)1 tablespoon mayonnaise2 drops stevia or to taste  Notes on the ingredients:  I prefer coconut chaff for Shuku Shuku because coconut flakes are too light and dry. You get coconut chaff from blending coconuts when makingcoconut milkandcoconut oil.You only need enough quantity of evaporated milk that will make the coconut chaff stick together. So just keep adding bit by bit till the chaff is sticky enough to make balls, it should not be soaking wet.You can also use condensed milk. I do not use it because it is too sweet for me and it is kind of sticky.  Directions  Baked Shuku Shuku  Put the coconut chaff in a deep bowl and add the egg yolks and the icing (powdered) sugar.Mix very well with a spatula till everything is well incorporated.Use fingertips to make small balls of Shuku Shuku, about the size of table tennis balls.Gently roll each ball on some bread crumbs till it is completely covered with bread crumbs.Place in the oven tray and bake in a preheated oven at 170°C (335°F) for 15-20 minutes.

One part should be slightly bigger than the other.Roll out the bigger dough to a 5mm thickness making sure that the diameter of the rolled out dough equals the diameter of your baking pan plus two times the depth of the pan and then some excess to allow for sealing the meat pie.Once happy, drape the flat dough on the pan and make it snug the inside corners of the pan.Fill the dough-lined baking pan with the filling.Brush some egg on the dough covering the edge of the pan.Roll out the remaining dough to 5mm thickness and a diameter that is a bit wider than that of the baking pan.Cover the pan with the rolled out dough and use a fork to seal the edges. Feel free to close the edges any how you like.Rub the egg on the dough. This gives the pie a golden brown look when done.Set the pan on a rack in the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes or till the top covering is golden brown.

Easy because the mixing is quite straight-forward and you will see proof that you are doing things right as you go along. It is only complicated when you do not follow the steps as detailed on this website. If this still fails,click here for the Easiest Nigerian Puff Puff Recipe.  Ingredients  For about 25 balls of Puff Puff, the size in the photo above, you will need:  2 cups (250g) of Plain Flour2 teaspoons of yeast (the one used in baking bread)½ teaspoon ground nutmeg½ cup granulated sugar (or to your taste)3 pinches of saltLukewarm water (for mixing)Vegetable Oil (for frying)  Before you make the Nigerian Puff Puff  If your yeast is the type that looks like tiny pebbles or is like paste, mix it with lukewarm water and set aside. you will add it later when you have added water to the Puff Puff mix. If your yeast is in powder form, then add it when you add the other dry ingredients to the flour (as mentioned below).  Directions  Put the flour in a bowl, add the ground nutmeg, powdered yeast, sugar and salt. Mix all these together.Add water in small quantities and mix everything by hand till you have a good blend of all the ingredients. Add the yeast you mixed with lukewarm water if applicable. Use warm water to mix the puff puff ingredients if you want it to rise faster.Keep mixing till the batter is smooth but not too watery to flow from a spoon. The mix should be much thicker thanpancakebatter (see video below).Cover the bowl with aluminum foil and make sure it is airtight by pressing the edges of the bowl (see video).Leave to rise for about 45 minutes. When OK to fry, the Puff Puff batter should have risen in quantity and will have some air bubbles.Pour some oil in a deep pot and allow to heat up. It's not advisable to use a deep fryer for Puff Puff because of the netting but if you want to use it, set the temperature to 170°C.Note:The oil should be at least 3 inches deep. This is so that the puff puff will become spherical when scooped into the oil. You don't want to end up with flatPancakes. lolTest that the oil is hot enough by putting a drop of batter into the oil. If it sizzles and comes up to the surface of the oil, then the oil is hot enough. If the oil is not hot enough, the batter will go down to the bottom of the oil and stay there.When the oil is hot enough, scoop some batter into the oil with your hand by pressing the batter to come out from between your thumb and index finger. You should see the video for this technique as this is what will make your Puff Puff have a near-perfect spherical shape.Put in more scoops of the batter, as much as the space in the frying pot will allow without overcrowding.Once the underside of the puff puff has turned golden brown, flip the ball so that the topside will be fried as well.When both sides are golden brown, take out the puff puff balls and place in a sieve.

If you are in Nigeria, look for them in big department stores like Shoprite.  For decorating the ice cream  HoneyCaramelFruits  Utensils and Equipment  Freezer2 Bowls: 1 should be big enough to accommodate the ice cream mixture, the other should be big enough to accommodate the first bowl.SpatulaPotIce cream spoon (optional)  Before you make the Vanilla Ice Cream  Make a large quantity of ice cubes. This will be used in cooling down the ice cream mixture in Step 8 below. I usually make at least 30 ice cubes for this.If you will be using a vanilla pod, cut it open by slicing along it to expose the seeds.Break the eggs and separate the yolk from the egg whites. For ice cream, we need only the egg yolks.  Directions for Vanilla Ice Cream  Pour the fresh milk and the whipping cream into a sizeable pot.Add the vanilla extract. If you are using a vanilla pod, add everything (seeds and fibre) to the milk and whipping cream in the pot.Start cooking on medium heat.While waiting for that to boil, whisk the egg yolks very well. Add the sugar and mix well.Once the contents of the pot start to boil, reduce the heat to very low. If you added vanilla pods, remove the fibre from the milk at this time.Once you see that the milk is no longer foaming so much (due to the reduced heat), slowly add the egg yolks to the milk, whipping cream and vanilla mixture. Stir till well incorporated.Increase the heat to medium and stir continuously till you notice the solution thickening. This should take about 10 minutes.Once you are happy, place the ice cubes into the big bowl and add some water to them. Pour the ice cream mixture into the smaller bowl and place this bowl into the ice water bath. Stir the ice cream mixture continuously (with a spatula) till it cools down completely. You may need to watch the video below to see how I did this.Place the bowl containing the ice cream mixture in the freezer. After 30 minutes, bring it out, stir very well with a spatula and place it back for another half an hour. Then bring it out and stir again. Repeat the process till a creamy solid is formed. It is important to stir very often because this prevents ice from forming in the ice cream. Depending on your freezer, this process takes between 3 and 5 hours.Once you are happy with the texture of the ice cream, serve and decorate with honey, caramel and/or fruits.If you have any left overs, put in a container, cover and place in your freezer till whenever. When you take it out of the freezer, it may appear rock solid unlike the ice cream purchased in the shops. All you have to do is leave it on your kitchen counter for 5 to 7 minutes or till it softens to ice cream texture before serving.

If you do not have it, add sugar to your taste. You can buy dates from any supermarket in the world. In Nigeria, Mallams that see coconut and tiger nuts (aki awusa, ofio, aya) sell dates. Just ask them for dabino.Vanilla give the soya milk its unique flavour. If you want your soya milk to taste like the one sold in 30cl glass bottles in Nigeria, vanilla flavour is essential.

Where to buy Tiger Nuts  There are 2 varieties of tiger nuts: brown and black. Both are readily available in Nigeria but I think the brown ones are more common outside Nigeria. Both taste the same to me.  In Nigeria, Tiger Nuts are sold by Hausa Mallams on the streets and in all major markets in Nigeria. You can also buy coconuts and dates (dabino) from them.In Spain, look for them in any Frutos Secos shop i.e. shops that sell dry fruits. Ask for chufas.In the UK you can buy them onAmazon UKwebsite.In the US, you can buy them onAmazon USwebsite.  Benefits of Tiger Nuts  Tigernut oil is used in the cosmetic industry. As it is antidioxide (because of its high content in vitamin E) it helps slow down the ageing of the body cells. It favours the elasticity of the skin and reduces skin wrinkles.It supplies the body with enough quantity of Vitamin E, very essential for fertility in both men and women.See more health benefits of tiger nutshere.  Directions for making Tiger Nut Milk  Soak the very dry nuts in a generous quantity of cold water for 2 days. Keep it in the fridge for the duration of the soaking so that the nuts do not ferment. Most tiger nuts sold in Nigeria are fresh and well hydrated so you\\'ll only need to soak those ones for a few hours or overnight.After the soaking, wash the nuts very well and sort out the bad ones.Put them in your kitchen blender and pour just enough water to help the blades move. We need to make this milk as concentrated and tasty as possible, you can add more water later if you wish.At this time you can add other ingredients: coconut, sugar, ginger and other flavours of your choice and blend them together. I prefer anything I eat/drink as natural as possible so I do not add any other ingredient to this drink. The natural taste of Tiger Nut Milk is so great, you do not want to alter it at all.After blending, use a chiffon cloth or ladies stocking (pantyhose) to separate the chaff from the drink. Of course, the pantyhose should be brand new, thoroughly washed with dish washing liquid.Press the stocking to make sure you squeeze out all the milk from the chaff.Put the dry chaff back in the blender, add more water and blend again. Then strain with the chiffon cloth.Repeat the process till all the milk has been extracted. I found that the milk I got the third time was too watery. So 2 times should be enough and keep an eye on the quantity of water. As a guide, I got 1.5 litres of tiger nut milk from 600g of soaked tiger nuts. Yours may vary.Pour the extracted milk into bottles and store in the fridge for up to 3 days. It should last longer in the freezer. In my home, this milk usually disappears within 2 days of making it, so I can\\'t tell you how long it can stay in the freezer without losing its taste! lol  Serve Tiger Nuts Milk with any snack of your choice.', 'category': 'Nigerian Drinks'}, {'title': 'Zobo Drink a.k.a.

Turn the fish on the other side and allow to boil for another 2 minutes then take them out from the fish stock.Note:We can fry the fish straight away without doing all this but we need to boil the fish for the following reasons:For a delicious stew, we need some fish stock (fish water lol) from the fish. The seasoning we add to the fish goes into the fish to make it taste better while the juice from the fish goes into the surrounding water to give it some nice taste that will make the stew delicious.This boiling process helps toughen the fish thereby preventing it from disintegrating in the stew.Set the fish stock aside.Shallow-fry the fish in a small quantity of vegetable oil till golden. The difference between deep-frying and shallow-frying is that in shallow frying, you use less amount of oil and the fish is not immersed in the oil. Both of them are great but I just think there is no need to use all that oil in frying especially when I can achieve the same thing with shallow frying. Also, I do not like my fish bone-dry as that is what we often aim for with deep-frying.Set the fish aside and set the pot with the fish stock back on this stove (medium heat).Once it boils again, add the tomato stew and habanero pepper.Add some water to bring the stew to the consistency you like for your stews. Some people like their stew watery, some like it conc and some like it somewhere in the middle.Add salt, stir and cover the pot and leave to simmer (boil) till you see some oil float to the surface of the stew. This is the oil from frying the Tomato Stew, no extra oil is added to Fish Stew. While waiting to see the oil, stir the stew at intervals so it does not burn.Once you see the oil at the top (watch the video below for what it should look like), add the fried fish.Stir, cover and once it boils again, the stew is ready!

Before you smoke the fish:  Clean the fish by removing the intestines and the gills. You may leave in the intestines if you like, as done by smoked fish mongers in Nigeria but the intestines give the fish a bitter taste when done. This is why I remove the intestines before smoking the fish.Rinse the fish thoroughly to clean all the blood.Rub some salt all over the fish. Do not go overboard with the salt, fish can easily get too salty.Bend the fish and put the tail fin across the mouth.

It goes well with Amala when served with Ewedu Soup.  Beans and Flatulence / Indigestion / Bloating  Flatulence, indigestion and bloating are the limiting factors for the consumption of beans. This has made beans so unpopular and caused a lot of people to abandon many nutritious beans recipes.  Beans contain oligosaccharides, the sugar molecule that requires special anti-oligosaccharide enzymes which is absent in the human digestive track to properly digest it. The incomplete digestion therefore produces gas which causes discomfort and flatulence. Some cooking methods and practices that can help reduce these sugar molecules in beans are detailed inHow to Reduce Beans Bloating.  Season  Bean is available all year round in Nigeria. A substantial quantity is cultivated in northern Nigeria.  Storage  Beans are best stored in airtight containers to prevent weevils from attacking them. They can last for months if properly stored.  Buying Guide  Beans are sold in the open Nigerian markets or African food stores all over the world. In the open Nigerian markets, they are sold in big bags in whole sale departments but sold in small cups as retail. Outside Nigeria, beans are often sold is small 1 kg packets.  When buying beans, it is best to look out for the onset of weevil attack. Small holes on the beans seeds is a good indication of this. Also, you will notice that the grains are dusty as a result of the weevils boring into the seeds.  Nutrition  Beans have significant amount of fibre, protein and iron.

Crayfish adds a very traditional flavour to whatever it is used to cook that is why you will mostly find it inNigerian SoupsforFufu meals,Concoction Riceand many more.  We usually grind crayfish into powder with a dry mill before adding it to Nigerian cooking. Sometimes, you will find it added as is inAbachaandUgba.  There's often a bit of a nomenclature war about what crayfish is. Is crayfish a shrimp, a prawn or even crawfish? Come to think of it, there's also some confusion when it comes to shrimps and prawns hence they are often used interchangeably in some countries.  Based on the characteristics of shrimps, I would say that the crayfish we have in Nigeria are more like shrimps. So crayfish can safely be referred to as dried shrimps. They range from very tiny to large ones that can be mistaken for prawns. In a mound of crayfish, you will mostly find tiny ones with big ones here and there.  The big ones known as Oporo are usually sorted out from the rest and sold separately because they are used in a different way when cooking Nigerian food.  The procedure detailed below also works for Dried Prawns or Dried Shrimps.  What you will need  Shrimps (frozen or fresh)  Notes  Shrimps are usually sold in the frozen section of supermarkets. If you live in a coastal town, you may be able to buy fresh ones from the fishermen.There is no need to add salt because shrimps are quite salty when dry. But then, I don't eat a lot of salt so you can add a tiny bit during step 2 if you wish.  Procedure for making the Crayfish  Keep the frozen shrimps on your kitchen counter to defrost. This takes a few minutes. Do not use a microwave oven to defrost it. If you have fresh shrimps, skip this step.When done, rinse with cool water and set aside to drain.Set your oven to top and down heating (bake) and 250°C (480F or Gas Mark 9) to preheat. If your oven settings are not up to these numbers, just go with the highest setting possible.Also turn on the oven fan if your oven has it. If not, no worries, it only means that yours will take longer than the drying times stated below.Place the shrimps or prawns (if it's what you are using) on your oven racks.Place in the preheated oven and bake for 25 minutes. Depending on the heating capacity of your oven, this may be less so please keep an eye on it.After 25 minutes, you will notice that they are almost dry. Dab some vegetable oil or any other tasteless and odourless cooking oil eg sun flower oil on the almost dry shrimps.Cover the oven and bake for additional 15 minutes. If your oven does not have a fan, you may need to bake them longer. Again depending on the heating capacity of your oven, it may take less. Overall, just keep a close eye on it from now on. At this point, the crayfish can go from golden eye candy to charred in no time.When completely dry but not charred, take them out from the oven and set aside to cool down completely.Store in a dry air tight container or in your freezer.  To use for Nigerian cooking, grind with a dry mill before adding to the dish or as directed in the recipe.

Nigerian 'Fried' Beans  In this recipe, beans is boiled and fried in red palm oil. It has a very traditional taste.  Recipes that require the peeling of beans:  Moi Moi (Moin Moin)  The beans coat is removed by a special technique and the beans blended and cooked with ingredients.

Peeled Beans Porridge  In this beans recipe, the beans coat is also removed and the beans cooked as inBeans Porridge.  Gbegiri Soup  Gbegiri Soup is a Yoruba soup prepared with beans. It goes well with Amala when served with Ewedu Soup.  Beans and Flatulence / Indigestion / Bloating  Flatulence, indigestion and bloating are the limiting factors for the consumption of beans. This has made beans so unpopular and caused a lot of people to abandon many nutritious beans recipes.  Beans contain oligosaccharides, the sugar molecule that requires special anti-oligosaccharide enzymes which is absent in the human digestive track to properly digest it. The incomplete digestion therefore produces gas which causes discomfort and flatulence. Some cooking methods and practices that can help reduce these sugar molecules in beans are detailed inHow to Reduce Beans Bloating.  Season  Bean is available all year round in Nigeria. A substantial quantity is cultivated in northern Nigeria.  Storage  Beans are best stored in airtight containers to prevent weevils from attacking them. They can last for months if properly stored.  Buying Guide  Beans are sold in the open Nigerian markets or African food stores all over the world. In the open Nigerian markets, they are sold in big bags in whole sale departments but sold in small cups as retail. Outside Nigeria, beans are often sold is small 1 kg packets.  When buying beans, it is best to look out for the onset of weevil attack. Small holes on the beans seeds is a good indication of this. Also, you will notice that the grains are dusty as a result of the weevils boring into the seeds.  Nutrition  Beans have significant amount of fibre, protein and iron. They are considered as healthy food because they contain lots of beneficial nutrients.\", 'category': 'Food and Ingredients'}, {'title': 'Nigerian Food Cocoyam', 'image_url': 'https://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cocoyam.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/food-ingredients/cocoyam/', 'information': 'Description|Recipes|Season|Storage|Buying Guide|Nutrition  Cocoyam  Pounding Cocoyam  Description  Cocoyam is a tropical starchy tuberous root crop.

Cocoyam Recipes  The soft variety is used mainly as a thickener in some Nigerian soup recipes which include:  Bitterleaf Soup  This is a very traditional soup, native to the eastern part of Nigeria.  Ora (Oha) Soup  The only difference between Ora Soup and Bitterleaf Soup is the vegetables used in preparing them, yet they taste so different.  Other recipes that are prepared with cocoyam are:  Achicha Ede  The cocoyam is cooked, cut into thin chips and dried in the sun. The resulting flakes are later soaked in water and cooked with vegetables.  Nigerian Ekpang Nkwukwo  In this meal, both the corms and the leaves of the cocoyam are used as ingredients.  Season  Cocoyam is planted a bit later in the rainy season, in the months of May and June. This is because it requires more moisture to germinate. Harvest for cocoyam begins in late September and ends around January, just before the dry season becomes too hot.  Storage  Cocoyam, like yam, can be stored for several months and it will still retain its taste. It is best stored in a cool, dry and well ventilated place. Most times they are stored on raised racks because the bare floor causes them to rot.  Buying Guide  Cocoyam, when in season, is readily available in the open Nigerian markets. It is harder to find them in African food stores outside Nigeria.  When buying cocoyam, carry out visual inspection of the corms. Press all parts of the corm to make sure that it is firm all over. Soft parts are the first indication that the cocoyam is going bad. Also avoid the ones with bruises or cracks as much as possible. Most bruises occur during harvest or transportation and may cause the affected parts to go bad.

Crayfish adds a very traditional flavour to whatever it is used to cook that is why you will mostly find it inNigerian SoupsforFufu meals,Concoction Riceand many more.  We usually grind crayfish into powder with a dry mill before adding it to Nigerian cooking. Sometimes, you will find it added as is inAbachaandUgba.  There's often a bit of a nomenclature war about what crayfish is. Is crayfish a shrimp, a prawn or even crawfish? Come to think of it, there's also some confusion when it comes to shrimps and prawns hence they are often used interchangeably in some countries.  Based on the characteristics of shrimps, I would say that the crayfish we have in Nigeria are more like shrimps. So crayfish can safely be referred to as dried shrimps. They range from very tiny to large ones that can be mistaken for prawns. In a mound of crayfish, you will mostly find tiny ones with big ones here and there.  The big ones known as Oporo are usually sorted out from the rest and sold separately because they are used in a different way when cooking Nigerian food.  The procedure detailed below also works for Dried Prawns or Dried Shrimps.  What you will need  Shrimps (frozen or fresh)  Notes  Shrimps are usually sold in the frozen section of supermarkets. If you live in a coastal town, you may be able to buy fresh ones from the fishermen.There is no need to add salt because shrimps are quite salty when dry. But then, I don't eat a lot of salt so you can add a tiny bit during step 2 if you wish.  Procedure for making the Crayfish  Keep the frozen shrimps on your kitchen counter to defrost. This takes a few minutes. Do not use a microwave oven to defrost it. If you have fresh shrimps, skip this step.When done, rinse with cool water and set aside to drain.Set your oven to top and down heating (bake) and 250°C (480F or Gas Mark 9) to preheat. If your oven settings are not up to these numbers, just go with the highest setting possible.Also turn on the oven fan if your oven has it. If not, no worries, it only means that yours will take longer than the drying times stated below.Place the shrimps or prawns (if it's what you are using) on your oven racks.Place in the preheated oven and bake for 25 minutes. Depending on the heating capacity of your oven, this may be less so please keep an eye on it.After 25 minutes, you will notice that they are almost dry. Dab some vegetable oil or any other tasteless and odourless cooking oil eg sun flower oil on the almost dry shrimps.Cover the oven and bake for additional 15 minutes. If your oven does not have a fan, you may need to bake them longer. Again depending on the heating capacity of your oven, it may take less. Overall, just keep a close eye on it from now on. At this point, the crayfish can go from golden eye candy to charred in no time.When completely dry but not charred, take them out from the oven and set aside to cool down completely.Store in a dry air tight container or in your freezer.  To use for Nigerian cooking, grind with a dry mill before adding to the dish or as directed in the recipe.

The seeds are then dried and the light brown husks removed by hand or mechanically.

Storage  Melon seeds properly stored with the shells can last for very long periods of time. It is best stored in air-tight containers. This is to keep out weevils and moisture. If the melon seeds are shelled, they do not last as long because in this state, it is easier for them to pick up moisture and become mouldy.Ground melon seeds should be used immediately but if stored in very cold temperatures, it can last up to a month and still retain its taste.  Buying Guide  Egusi (melon) seeds are readily available in the open Nigerian markets or African food stores all over the world. When buying egusi in the open Nigerian markets, you should check for dust. If the seeds are dusty, it means they have been in storage for too long.It is best to buy melon seeds harvested from the year before because this ensures that they are very dry. Newly harvested melon seeds are not the best for preparing Egusi Soups because they are not so dry yet and may cause indigestion.

So here is a list of the essential ingredients for Nigerian food recipes. You can buy all these ingredients in Nigerian food markets and African food shops in all major cities of the world.  Watchthis video,this videoandthis videoto see some of these ingredients in living colour.  1. Stock Cubes  In Nigeria, we use stock cubes to cook virtually every recipe:Soups recipes,Rice recipes,Beans recipesorPlantain. Once you will add ingredients to the Nigerian meal you are cooking, then you should add stock cubes to it unless you do not eat them at all.  The most popular stock cubes used in Nigerian food recipes are Knorr, Maggi and Royco. If you are allergic to MSG or you do not want to eat it, read the labels of these seasoning cubes to make sure the one you are using does not contain MSG. You can also make yours.Click here.  2. Salt  Salt is added to almost every Nigerian food recipe. The exception to this beingCustard/Akamu/Ogiand the fufu meals. For the fufu meals, they get their taste from the soup that goes with the meal.  If you are advised by a doctor to stay off salt, then by all means leave it out when preparing your Nigerian meals.  3. Thyme  Thyme is an important seasoning when cooking beef or chicken for Stew and Rice recipes. Please do not add thyme when cooking meat that you will use to prepareNigerian Soup recipes. That's a big no-no.  4. Onions (Red or White)  Onions should be used when cooking beef or chicken that you will use to prepare theNigerian Stew Recipesand theNigerian Rice Recipes. It can also be used for some Nigerian Soup Recipes examples:Okra Soup,Pepper Soup,Banga SoupandEdikang Ikong Soup. It is not advisable to use onions forEgusi Soupbut it's not too bad if you use it.  But NEVER add onions toBitterleaf SoupandOra (Oha) Soup. It will take away the traditional/classic taste of these soups.  5. Palm Oil  Palm oil is the preferred cooking oil when you want to prepare Nigerian Soup recipes. The best palm oils are the ones that are pure red and free flowing.  If the palm oil is orange or even yellow in colour, it means it was not well processed and contains a lot of water. This may cause it to be smelly and this will adversely affect the taste of your Nigerian soup dishes.  Congealed palm oil is not necessarily bad. Most palm oil sold in western countries may be congealed due to the cold weather.  6. Vegetable Oil  Pure vegetable oil is used to cook all Nigerian Rice Recipes and Nigerian tomato stew. It is also used for any recipe that requires frying, examples: Fried Plantain, Fried Yam and all the fried Snacks recipes.  Groundnut Oil is used as an alternative to pure vegetable oil but due to its strong taste, it is not so popular.  If you are outside Nigeria, Sunflower Oil is a very good alternative to pure vegetable oil. Whatever you do, NEVER use Olive Oil to cook Nigerian recipes. The taste is so strong that the food will not taste Nigerian.  7. Peppers  These include all hot peppers: fresh, dry, chilli, habanero or scotch bonnet peppers.With the exception of Nigerian Snacks and Nigerian Fried Rice, hot chilli pepper is present in all Nigerian foods. Even if you don't like pepper, it is always good to add a tiny quantity because this will bring out the taste of your Nigerian meals. If pepper is absent, the food will taste bland to any Nigerian person.  8. Curry Powder  Curry powder is mainly used when cooking Nigerian Fried Rice. This curry powder is what gives the meal the yellow color so endeavour to add curry powder else your Nigerian Fried Rice will not look appetizing.  Please note that this curry powder is not the hot Indian curry. It only serves as a colourant. Ask your African food grocer for Nigerian or African curry powder that does not contain chilli.  You can also add this curry powder to Nigerian Beef and Chicken Stew to help remove traces of sour tomato taste. It also gives the stew a nice flavour.  9. Plain Flour  Plain flour is the basis of a majority of Nigerian snacks. Flour is often used as a thickener for the Nigerian Vegetable Sauce.  Plain flour is used to prepare some quick and easy recipes so you should always have it in your kitchen.  10. Plum Tomatoes  In Nigeria, we use only one type of fresh tomatoes; plum tomatoes to cook Nigerian dishes. This is known astomate perain Spanish andpomodoro perain Italian.  Most other types of tomatoes have strong smell and taste so they are not good for preparing the Nigerian Tomato Stew or Nigerian rice recipes.  11. Crayfish  Crayfishis essential when preparing Nigerian soup recipes. If you don't have it where you live,you can make some. Use it especially in Nigerian soups because it makes them taste good.  12. Nutmeg  Nutmeg is not used in a lot of Nigerian recipes but when it is used, it plays a very important role. Nutmeg is the ingredient that gives Nigerian Moi Moi, Nigerian Puff Puff and Nigerian Chin Chin their unique taste so do not miss adding nutmeg to these Nigerian recipes.\", 'category': 'Food and Ingredients'}, {'title': 'Rice', 'image_url': 'https://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/rice-grains.jpg', 'url': 'https://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/food-ingredients/rice/', 'information': \"Description|Recipes|Season|Storage|Buying Guide|Nutrition  Boiled White Rice  Description  Rice is a cereal grain. It is produced in places with high rainfall as it requires plenty of water for its cultivation. Rice seeds are usually 5 to 10 mm long and about 3 mm thick. It is a favourite staple food in Nigeria. There are many varieties of rice but the most consumed variety in Nigeria is the parboiled long-grain white rice. Rice is mostly popular because it can be eaten with a wide variety of sauces. It is also used to prepare party recipes.  Rice Recipes  Rice is mostly boiled to cook a variety of Nigerian food recipes.

Season  Rice is abundant all year round. Even though significant quantities of rice are cultivated in Nigeria, tons of rice are imported into the country to meet demands.  Storage  If stored properly, rice can last for very long periods of time. It is best to store in air-tight containers. This is to keep out dust, weevils and moisture. Cooked rice can be stored in the freezer for up to 10 days and it will still maintain its taste.  Buying Guide  Rice is readily available in the open Nigerian markets or food stores all over the world. Rice sold in food stores abroad come in sealed packets so watch out for expiry dates. When buying rice in the open Nigerian markets, you should check the rice for dust. If the grains are dusty, it means the rice has been in storage for too long and probably weevils have started attacking the grains.  Also make sure that the grains are very dry rather than damp. During transportation, the bags of rice may come in contact with water. Rice is sold in 25kg and 50 kg bags. Sales in small measuring cups are also common in Nigerian street markets. If you are buying in bags, the marketers use a special tool to bring out samples of the grain which you will use to visually check the grains.  Nutrition  Brown rice is rich in fibre, magnesium, vitamins B1, B3 and B6. Most of these nutrients are lost during milling which is the process that converts brown rice to the parboiled long-grain white rice we use in preparing Nigerian food recipes. Not to worry,Nigerian rice recipesare prepared with lots of ingredients rich in vitamins and minerals thereby regaining the 'lost' nutrients.\", 'category': 'Food and Ingredients'}, {'title': 'Special Ingredient: Tamarind (Tsamiya in Hausa)', 'image_url': 'https://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/bimages/tamarind.jpg', 'url': 'http://blog.allnigerianrecipes.com/tamarind/', 'information': 'Sometime ago, I was having a conversation with the ladies ofRate My Nigerian Foodabout how they use Tamarind (Tsamiya) and I was wondering when I will ever lay my hands on it.

The first sets are harvested in late July with the last batch harvested in early December.  Storage  Yam can be stored for several months and it will still retain its taste. It is best stored in a cool, dry and well ventilated place. Raw yam should not be stored in very cold temperatures eg the refrigerator as this changes the taste.  Buying Guide  Yam is readily available in the open Nigerian markets or African food stores all over the world. However when buying yam in non-African shops abroad, be aware that some produce labelled as yam is not really yam but some variety of tuber crops that may be better classified as sweet potato.  Since yams are harvested from the month of July, they are cheapest at this time of the year then become increasing expensive as the next planting season approaches.  When buying yam, ask for white/sweet yam. This is the tastiest of them all unless a doctor prescribed water yam for you. Before you buy, carry out visual inspection of the yam. Press all parts of the tuber to make sure that it is firm all over. Soft parts are the first indication that the yam is going bad. Also, avoid the ones with bruises or cracks as much as possible. Most bruises occur during harvest and cause the affected part to go bad.

With a little alteration, it is suitable for vegetarians.White Moi Moi [Video]  White Moi Moi (Ekuru) is to regular Moi Moi what Agidi is to Agidi Jollof or what Boiled White Rice is to Jollof Rice.  It is prepared the same way as regular Moi Moi but with less added ingredients. It gets most of its taste and colour from the stew it is served with.  On its own, White Moi Moi is tasty due to the seasoning it contains so you can skip the stew and enjoy it with a chilled drink.  How to Cook Nigerian Moi Moi with LeavesHow to Cook Nigerian Moi Moi with Beans Flour  Ingredients  For 4 medium wraps of White Moi Moi, you will need:  For the White Moi Moi  360g black eyed or brown beans1 small onion1 big stock cubeSalt (to taste)600mls lukewarm water2 cooking spoons vegetable oil (optional)  For the stew  250mlsTomato Stew2 small smoked mackerels1 small onion1 small stock cubeSalt and Habanero pepper (to taste)1 teaspoon nutmeg  White Moi Moi Containers  Aluminium foilorPlastic BowlsorUma Leaves(Thaumatococcus Daniellii)  Tools  BlenderSpatulaBowls  Note about the ingredients  The job of the vegetable oil is to help the Moi Moi come out of the container easily when done.  Before you cook White Moi Moi  About three hours before cooking the moi moi, soak andpeel the beans.When done with step 1, put the peeled beans in a bowl and pour enough water to cover it. Leave to soak for three hours. This is so that the best consistency will be achieved when you blend the beans.Prepare Tomato Stew if you do not have some.Prepare the moi moi containers.Prepare some Smoked Fish and break into big chunks.Pound/grind the pepper.Cut the onions into small pieces.Crush the stock cubes.  Cooking Directions: The White Moi Moi  Blend the beans with the onions and crushed stock cubes and pour into a big enough bowl. Please note that the total quantity of water to be used (for blending and mixing) should be 600 mls.Add the vegetable oil (if using it) and stir.Slowly add the remaining water and stir the mixture at the same time till you get a good mix of all the ingredients.Add salt to taste and stir very well.Set some water in a pot to boil. The water should be about 1 cm deep.When the water boils, add some padding that will be a base for the Moi Moi wraps.Scoop the Moi Moi mix into your container of choice and gently place in the pot of boiling water.Repeat step 7 for the rest of the Moi Moi mix.When done, cover the wraps with some leaves or a plastic bag to keep the heat in.Cover the pot and start cooking on medium heat.Check it from time to time and add small quantities of water at a time when necessary.The length of time you will cook your Moi Moi depends on the quantity and the Moi Moi container you used.The Moi Moi that gets done quickest is the one wrapped in Uma or Banana leaves, followed by Moi Moi wrapped in aluminum foils then the one that takes the most time is Moi Moi cooked in aluminium or plastic plates.But whatever Moi Moi container you use, it is advisable to cook your Moi Moi for at least 1 hour, before checking it. Confirm that it is done by putting a knife through it, if the knife is stained with Moi Moi paste, then the Moi Moi is not done, but if the knife just has a slight smear of Moi Moi, then it's done. Also, when you cut through the Moi Moi, the insides will be set and not watery.If you are cooking a few wraps of Moi Moi in a small pot on high heat, then it will only take about 45 minutes to get done while when you are cooking a large pot of Moi Moi, it will definitely take more than one hour.  Cooking Directions: The Stew  You can eat white Moi Moi with any tomato based stew, make sure the stew is seasoned with at least one traditional ingredient:smoked fish, iru,crayfish. This is how I prepare mine and it is so delicious, goes really well with the beans.  Put the chunks of fish in a clean pot.Add the onions, some water, stock cube, pepper and nutmeg. Stir and start cooking.Once it boils, add the tomato stew.Cover and leave to simmer and it’s done!

Because these videos were recorded live, I answered lots of questions asked by those watching me live. So I recommend you take the time to watch all these videos. You will be happy you did.  Ingredients  I usually cook Moi Moi in a large quantity and store in my freezer so the following quantities of ingredients make 12 aluminium bags of Moi Moi. Each bag weighs 420g.  3 cigar cups or 750g Beans (Brown/Black eyed)5 tablespoons groundcrayfish4 big stock cubes1 habanero pepper2 teaspoons ground nutmeg3 tatashe peppers or 800g watery tomato puree (sold outside Nigeria)2 big onions20cl vegetable oil2 litres of cool or warm waterSalt (to taste)  Moi Moi Accessories  Add any of the following to the Moi Moi  Hard boiled eggs: Cut the eggs into small pieces.Bone Marrow: Cook the bone marrow with spices and herbs till done then add to the Moi Moi at the mixing stage.Corned beef: separate into small chunks and add to the moi moi during mixing. You can also add to the moi moi after dishing then into cooking bowls or foil bags.  Moi Moi Containers  Aluminium foilorPlastic BowlsorUma Leaves(Thaumatococcus Daniellii)Jacket Moi Moi  Tools I used  CookerDeep PotSpatulaChopping boardBlenderKnives  Notes on the ingredients  The tomato puree gives the Moi Moi its classic peachy colour. If you are in Nigeria, the best ingredient to use is tatashe pepper. I do not like the taste of red bell peppers in my Moi Moi hence I do not recommend it but you can try it and see if you like it.Nutmeg gives the Moi Moi its classic taste. If you've ever eaten Nigerian Moi Moi at a party and wondered why it tastes better than the ones you make, it is probably because you do not add nutmeg to your Moi Moi.2 litres of water is the exact quantity of water that gives me the perfect texture of Moi Moi that I and my family love. Please note that this qauntity includes the water used in blending the beans. If using bone marrow, the quantity of stock should be part of the 2 litres of liquid you will use in mixing the Moi Moi. If after using this quantity and you are not happy with the texture, adjust the quantity of water accordingly.It is best to use cool orwarmwater when mixing Moi Moi. You do not want to use hot water for this purpose as it may cause the mix to be lumpy.Using the right amount of oil in your Moi Moi ensures that it has a good texture and rolls off the tongue when you eat it but feel free to use any amount of oil you want. And it is advisable to use tastless and odourless oils in your Moi Moi so that rules out olive oil.  Before you cook Moi Moi  About three hours before cooking the moi moi, soak and wash the beans toremove the coat. When the entire coat has been removed, place the beans in a bowl and pour enough water to cover it. Leave to soak for three hours. This is so that the best consistency will be achieved when you blend the beans.It is advisable to use one of eggs, bone marrow or corned beef, not the three at the same time. If you will use eggs, cook till hard boiled, cut into small pieces and set aside. If you prefer bone marrow, cook it with salt and Maggi / Knorr cubes and set aside the stock. If it is corned beef you will go for, open the can and separate the beef into small lumps.Now go ahead andprepare the moi moi containers.  Next …  Wash the tatashe pepper (if using it). Ensure you remove the tatashe seeds as they have a tendency to give meals a bitter taste.Cut the onions into pieces, grind the crayfish with a dry mill. If using the heavy duty grinder in Nigerian markets, these won't be necessary.Crush the stock cubes and set aside. Wash the habanero/scotch bonnet peppers and set aside.Now that the beans is soaked (the bean seed is tender when you pinch it), it is time to blend it. It is very important that you use a very good blender for this purpose. The taste and feel of your Moi Moi depends so much on the consistency of the blend. If in doubt, put a small quantity of bean seeds in your home blender and grind to the best of its ability using as small quantity of water as possible. Feel the resulting paste with your fingers and if you notice any tiny pieces at all, then the blender is not good for Moi Moi. At this time, you may consider using the commercial heavy duty mills at your local market if you are in Nigeria. Yes, you have your health and hygiene concerns but most of the mill operators actually keep their mills clean. And they let you bring your own water and containers. So there you go!  How to Cook Moi Moi with Tins  Cooking Directions  Blend the beans, tatashe or tomato puree, onions, crayfish, habanero pepper and ground nutmeg together with some of the water and pour the mix into a big enough bowl.Add the vegetable oil and the bone marrow stock (if this is what you have chosen to add to your moi moi).Slowly add the remaining water and stir the mixture at the same time till you get a good mix of all the ingredients.Add salt to taste and stir very well.Note:Moi Moi is one of the Nigerian food recipes that is prepared cold. All the mixing and adding of ingredients is done off the stove. That is to say, once you start cooking, there is no going back! You cannot decide to add more salt or seasoning or a new ingredient later. So getting it right at the mixing stage is very important.Pad the base of a big pot, pour some water and set on the stove. The depth of the water should be at most 1 inch.Dish the Moi moi mix into containers of your choice, add egg/bone marrow/corned beef to each container, seal/cover and set them in the pot.Add as small quantity of water as possible at a time while cooking the Moi Moi as detailed inpreparation and use of moi moi containersso that the moi moi will not become watery when done. This is the case especially when using aluminium foil or uma leaves.The length of time you will cook your Moi Moi depends on the quantity and the Moi Moi container you used.The Moi Moi that gets done quickest is the one wrapped in Uma or Banana leaves, followed by Moi Moi wrapped in aluminum foils then the one that takes the most time is Moi Moi cooked in aluminium or plastic plates.But whatever Moi Moi container you use, it is advisable to cook your Moi Moi for at least 1 hour, before checking it.

You can also add to the moi moi after dishing then into cooking bowls or foil bags.  Containers  Aluminium foilorPlastic BowlsorUma Leaves(Thaumatococcus Daniellii)Jacket Moi Moi  Notes on the ingredients  The tomato puree gives the Moi Moi its classic peachy colour. If you are in Nigeria, the best ingredient to use is tatashe pepper. I do not like the taste of red bell peppers in my Moi Moi hence I do not recommend it but you can try it and see if you like it.Nutmeg gives the Moi Moi its classic taste. It is very essential.I used 1.2 litres of water because I love soft Moi Moi. This quantity includes the water used to mix the Moi Moi and that used to mix the dry ingredients. If using bone marrow, the quantity of stock should be part of the 1.2 litres of liquid you will use in mixing the Moi Moi. If after using this quantity and you are not happy with the texture, adjust the quantity of water accordingly but I recommend that you use at least 1 litre of water for the 250g of beans flour else the Moi Moi will be hard.It is best to use cool water when mixing the beans flour.Using the right amount of oil in your Moi Moi ensures that it has a good texture and rolls off the tongue when you eat it but feel free to use any amount of oil you want. And it is advisable to use tastless and odourless oils in Nigerian Moi Moi.  Before you cook Moi Moi  Prepare the moi moi containers.Mix the beans flour with 500mls of cool water, making sure there are minimal lumps. You can achieve this by adding a small quantity of water, mix that then add another small quantity. When done, cover and leave to soak for three hours.It is advisable to use one of eggs, bone marrow or corned beef, not the three at the same time. If you will use eggs, cook till hard boiled, cut each egg into about 4 pieces and set aside. If you prefer bone marrow, cook it with big chunks of onion, salt and stock cubes and set aside the stock. If using corned beef, open the can and separate the beef into small lumps.Wash the tatashe pepper (if using it). Remove the tatashe seeds cut the flesh into tiny pieces. Wash the habanero/scotch bonnet peppers, cut into small pieces and set aside.Cut the onions into pieces, grind the crayfish with a dry mill.Crush the stock cubes and set aside. Grind the nutmeg if you bought the nuts.Mix the ground crayfish, ground nutmeg, crushed stock cubes, pepper and tomato puree with a small amount of water and set aside.  Cooking Directions  After 3 hours, pour the mixture of ingredients into the bowl of soaked beans flour. Add the chopped onions and tatashe (if using it). Stir very well to mix.Blend the mixture from 1 above in small batches without adding any more water till you get a smooth Moi Moi batter. When done, pour into a big enough bowl.Set a small amount of water on the stove to boil. Use a big pot.Slowly add the remaining water to the Moi Moi batter and stir the mixture at the same time.Add the vegetable oil. If using corned beef, add the pieces now. If using bone marrow, add it with the stock at this time. Remember to reduce the total quantity of water you will use for the recipe by the quantity of the bone marrow stock.Add salt to taste and stir very well.By now the water should have boiled. Add a base for the Moi Moi bags to the pot. You can use a metallic wire mesh, pieces of aluminium foil or plastic bags.Dish the Moi moi mix into containers of your choice, add egg to each container, seal/cover and set them in the pot. When done, cover them with a large piece of aluminium foil or a plastic bag to keep the heat in. Then cover start cooking on medium heat.While cooking, keep an eye on the Moi Moi and add some water if necessary.Cook for at least one and half hours and it should be done. If using bowls, it will take longer. Confirm that it is done by putting a knife through it, if the knife is stained with Moi Moi paste, then the Moi Moi is not done, but if the knife just has a slight smear of Moi Moi, then it's done.Spread the bags out on a tray to cool down to a comfortable temperature.  Serve with allNigerian rice dishes,Fried Plantains,Akamu or Ogi(for breakfast) or withSteamed Vegetables. You can also serve Moi Moi as a snack with a chilled drink.\", 'category': 'Nigerian Beans Recipes', 'title': 'Nigerian Moi Moi with Beans Flour'}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None)]\n"
